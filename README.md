# Taylor Swift Podcast Lyrical Pattern Analysis

Analysis of lyrical patterns in Taylor Swift's podcast appearance using NLP and deep learning techniques.

## üéØ Project Goals
- Extract potential TS 12 song material from conversational speech
- Identify stylistic patterns characteristic of Taylor Swift's songwriting
- Compare semantic vs stylistic similarity metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Methods
- **Video Processing**: yt_dlp for YouTube download, ffmpeg for audio extraction
- **Audio Processing**: pyannote for speaker diarization, Whisper for transcription. Note: Requires HuggingFace token for pyannote (use your own)
- **NLP Analysis**: TF-IDF, BERT embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2)
- **Style Classification**: Custom neural network with triplet loss training

## üìä Results
What the analysis showed is that Miss Americana, when happy, speaks very rhythmically and in harmony with *Red* and *1989* albums, which actually makes it hard to pinpoint where the real Easter eggs are. But when we trained a model to distinguish podcast speech style from song lyrics style, we found that we can definitely expect to hear about "end of my night," be sure that "there's a poem in this," and that "life is more upbeat."

The next step could be connecting large LLM APIs to generate lyrics inspired by the discovered patterns ‚Äî but honestly, I doubt AI can recreate the artistry of someone who wrote a line like "Cause something counterfeit's dead." So just enjoy the mathematical profile of TS songs, and let's be excited for "The Life of a Showgirl."
