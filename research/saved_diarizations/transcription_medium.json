  "text": " All right, let's get to the part of this show that I think is what everybody is going to be talking about. Do I get to say it? Do I get to say I get to say the two words? Yes. First of all, you can do whatever you want to. I don't know. We're not going to review. This is very much whatever within the framework of the podcast. I'm a fan of the podcast. Typically allow the guests to say new news. Yeah, I want to do it. I think Taylor has a little bit of new news. Welcome back to New Heights. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, 92 percenters, we missed you. This is a very special episode of New Heights, a Wondry show. We are your hosts.

Jason, oh, we got a good one. Why don't you tell the people what we got coming up? That's right. 92 percenters. You may remember when we said New Heights wasn't coming back till August 27th. Well, that was a lie. That was a lie. And hopefully you can forgive us because we got a as Travis said, we have a very special episode today that we just simply could not turn down. That's right. This is a special preseason episode that we decided to bring to you a little early. So let's not waste any of their time, Jason. Let's get right to it. Want to do the honors? Our guest today is the singer, songwriter, producer and director from Nashville, Tennessee. That's bullshit. She is from waiting. She is the most awarded artist in the history of the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards and I Heart Radio Music Awards. She has 14 Grammy Awards and is the only artist in the history to an album of the year four times. Last December, she wrapped up the Heiress tour, which spanned 149 shows across 51 cities, five continents. It was the most attended tour of all time. I'm still going. Her last album, the Torture Post Department set a record with 1.76 billion streams globally within the first week alone. As a fan of that guy on the Chiefs, she has 19 wins, two ASE titles and a Super Bowl. 92% of you, are you ready for it? Making your podcasting debut, the most acclaimed guest in the history of shows, Taylor Swift. What's that intro, Jason? Oh my God. I've seen this before. Look, his soul has left his body. Just breathe. No, that was so good. Thank you. I tried to. Thank you for screaming for like 47 seconds for me. That was so nice. I'm shaking right now. I'm shaking. No, you did a great job. Take a deep breath. Did I get everything? How much more could we have put in that? Like I felt like that was. That was such an amazing intro and also just like thanks for wearing the merch. It goes a long way. Just like immediately makes me feel comfortable just looking deeply into my own eyes. Okay. All right. That's what I was going for. It's a good t-shirt. I like it. Thanks for having me. This is my first podcast. This is amazing. Thank you for coming on. What took you so long to jump on podcasts? You know what? I just, I was waiting for you guys to invite me. This is my favorite podcast. So we've already been over this. You're a big fan of the show. You're a 92 percenter. What are your favorite segments that you hear Travis and I go into on a routinely basis? I like new news just because of the screaming. Like I hear him screaming new news from across the house constantly. It's like my favorite part. Like he'll be like new news, new news. And I'm in the kitchen. So I love that because of just the bellowing of it. Like I love no dumb questions. That's a banger. I really like it when you give people advice. It's my, it's kind of my personal favorite. Do you usually agree with the advice or do you just like listening to it? I mean, I think that like you guys give such male centric advice. Which I think is just like just dudes who don't want drama. Dudes who are trying to avoid the mess. But sometimes you're going to like do a bit and say the messiest thing that they could do, which is funny too. So we're going to ask the question everybody watching the show is currently asking. Why are you coming on the show? Why? What are you doing? There's so many better things to do at your time. This podcast has done a lot for me. I owe a lot to this podcast. This podcast got me a boyfriend. Ever since Travis decided to use it as his personal dating app about two years ago. So worked pretty good. Yeah. Hey, were his friendship bracelets that good? Did you give the friendship bracelets or was that just on the podcast? I've never, I've never seen the original. Didn't leave the stadium because I was butt hurt. Jason was, he threw a tantrum. It's so funny. It's like, she loves me. She loves me. Not she loves me. She loves me. This is so like, it was such a wild romantic gesture to just be like, I don't want to date you like on, I don't know. It was at first when I looked at it, I was like, that's what it does when you're on the stage and you perform an arrowhead. That's what it did. This dude didn't get a meet and greet. He's making it everyone's problem. That's what I thought it was. You come to arrowhead, I get to meet you. That's the perk of playing for the chiefs. You realize he didn't even reach out to our management. I was like, when this podcast came out, I was like, did he ever reach out to be like in the tents or did we know he was in the building? He came with Pat and he thought that because he knows the elevator lady that he could talk to her about just getting down to my dressing room. That's how it works. You just go. And I got denied. That's how it works in 1973. But yeah, but yeah, he really just was like, I know a guy I can figure this out. But I actually when I thought about it, I was like, actually, we live in a day and age where I'm not a very I'm not an online person at all. I'm not like on social media like that. And like, I'm genuinely terrified to open my DMS. Smart. It's just like it's just like, it's about it. I just there's smoke coming out of my DMS. I don't want to go near that. I don't know what you want somebody to go through. I'll go through it just because I'll go through it. Somebody to go through it. I'll go through it just because I'll laugh my ass off. It's like if you have like 20 million unread DMS, you're saying, Are you not entertained? So this kind of felt more like I was in an 80s John Hughes movie and he was just like standing outside of my window with a boombox just being like, I want to date you. Yeah. Do you want to go on a date with me? I made you a friendship place. Do you want to date me? Just come outside and meet me. Just meet me once. Give me a chance. I was like, if this guy isn't crazy, which is a big if. This is sort of what I've been writing songs about wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager and I was sitting there at the air store listening to every single one of the songs like she I know that she wants me to do. I feel that that's what she wants me to do. She's like, this is just her wish list of like, meet me please now. I'm butthurt. Yeah, I'm upset that you didn't meet me even though you didn't know I wanted to meet you because I didn't do any proper logistical planning. Who plans now? Kelsey, Kelsey. It was wild. It was wild, but it worked. I'm glad it worked. I'm just circling back to New Heights to say thank you for this. Look at this. I'm the luckiest man in the world. So yeah, that's thank you to New Heights. All the editing. Jake, thank you for putting that on social media and letting it do its work. Before we move on. What? How did you know he wasn't crazy? Because that's the other side of that, right? Like a guy goes up there and professes his love for you. It's either one. It's like this could be the most romantic thing in the world. It can also be like this is. He is crazy, Jason. But there's a right crazy. Yeah, he's the good kind of crazy. And I knew that he wasn't crazy the first couple of times that we talked. I was just like, he's truly like, he's truly getting to know me in a way that's very natural, very pure, very normal. Like also, like just the way that he could make me laugh so immediately about normal things. The like Travis is like he's just a vibe booster in everyone's life that he's in. He's like a human exclamation point. Like, you know, he's like when you take a picture on your phone and you put the like you push the enhanced color button, that's like what you do. I just I'm always so I've got so many more exclamation points now. But I think it was just like you also you were so you're so nonjudgmental about people and you were not judgmental about the fact that I knew nothing about the world you were in. It was the best. You were nice. You were so nice. I got a clean slate. You were like, thank you. She doesn't know any of my fans. Are you kidding me? Jason, on our first date, I literally I legitimately asked him what it was like when the Chiefs played the Eagles in the Super Bowl and he looked across the board and he was like, oh, I'm so excited. And he looked across the field across the line of scrimmage and saw his brother standing on the other like five feet in front of him on the field. And he was like, he was and he didn't even he didn't even look at me. But I now know what an insane question that was. He was like, actually, I'm on the offense and my brother's on the offense and I'm only on the field at the same time as defense. I thought everyone was on there at the same time. I thought I thought that the quarterback, I mean, that's how you played it. I'm on the playground growing up. So I understand if you hadn't like, no, you don't understand. I thought it was like Jared Goff is here and Josh Allen's here. And they're going to be like they blow a whistle and then they they go at each other and they're like, who's going to win? That's actually I would love to see Jared Goff play some defense. Let's see. I've got some ideas. I've got some thoughts. Yeah, I didn't know what a first down was. I didn't know what the chains were. I didn't know what a tight end was. I am forever thankful for you diving into the football world wholeheartedly. Oh, my God. I fell in love with it. I became obsessed with it. I became like a person who was running through the halls of my house screaming, we drafted Xavier worthy. And my friends are like, what is who? Body snatched you. This is this is what do you mean? We drafted Xavier worthy. I forget where I was, but you were the first person to tell me that I was the fastest man in the draft. No, I was screeching. I couldn't believe it. I was freaking out. We're talking about like I'm like, wait, does she she write? I had to look this up. I'm like, she she get the wrong information here. But yeah, we traded up. Yeah, we're talking about cover to cover for cover zero man. We're talking we're we're learning. I think we I continue to learn. Maybe somebody else that even knows what those coverages are. Yeah, I'm not ready to be an analyst right now. But give me 16 months. You're gonna pick up on it. I'm telling you, you would ask some of the best questions when we were up in the booth and there's like your desire to learn more. But your genuine excitement around it as well as like your competitiveness. She's not fucking around. No, he's not fucking around. My God, he's not fucking around. Reclaiming masters. You want to let's tee it up. One of one of my favorite things this summer was Taylor reclaiming her masters. Her recording of her first six albums finally became hers. Yeah. And you haven't really talked about it. You made that beautiful post on all your social channels, thanking everyone that made it happen and everything. But why don't you tell tell the 92 percenters how it really felt? Oh, so to catch anyone up who doesn't know about this saga, like I signed a record deal when I was 15 and I always kind of refer to it as I got my music back this this summer. But I never owned my music at all. So traditionally, a lot of record deals are set up in a way that artists don't own what's called their master recordings. Owning your master recordings means that you have complete control and power over distribution, licensing and essentially the way your legacy is shaped. It's it's it's a huge thing. It's always been a huge thing for me. Like since I was a teenager, I've been actively saving up money to buy my music back and to ever own it in the first place because it's usually the label that owns it. But I've always wanted this to happen. So it's been sold. My music has been sold a few times. The first time that it was sold, it really ripped my heart out of my chest. And I told everybody exactly how that felt for me and what I was going through. And I started basically defiantly rerecording my music because I wanted I wanted to own it. And this was the only way I thought it was ever going to happen. And so I knew she had a bad kid and she's got she's got a little bit of a bad kid. Yeah, bad kid. That's a savvy kid. That's like, hey, I've been told I've been defined a lot of times. You are defined. You're very defined. It's like I am insubordinate, Travis. Insubordinate. Yeah, it's I think for me, you know, that was the closest I ever thought I would get to owning my music. And so rerecording my music, it was so exciting to get to have that opportunity. But there was still like I thought about not owning my music every day. It was something that I never was. It's like an intrusive thought that I had every day. And so we do the Ares tour after the Ares tour. I had a meeting with my team and we we decided this might be a good time to approach the current owners of it. The owners of it was a private equity firm called Shamrock Capital. I knew them to be above board people. You know, they had been very friendly to us. What I was looking to do, though, was I wanted to buy my music outright. I don't want to be in a partnership. I don't want to own 30 percent of it. I want it. I want to own all of it. And you deserve that. But it was a long shot to think that they would do that, that they would sell that that asset to me. It's a big asset. It's a huge decision for them to make to sell that to anyone, including me. I decided that rather than this be like a business conversation, I I'm in the business of human emotion. I would so much rather lead heart first in something like this, because for me, this is not, oh, I want to I want to own this asset because if it's returns, because if it's, you know, because of the dividends that I will receive over the years, this was I want it because this is my handwritten diary entries from my whole life. These are the songs I wrote about every phase of my life. This is my photography, my music videos, my most of which I funded. You know, my artwork, everything that I've ever done is in this catalog. And so rather than send lawyers or management like in a big crew, I sent my mom and my brother, who I work with, to L.A. And they sorry, they sat down and they like this happens. I don't ever really talk about it because it's they sat with with Shamrock Capital and they told them what this meant for me. Like this is they told them the whole story of all the times we've tried to buy it, all the times it's fallen through, all the times we had gotten plans together and figured out something we thought was going to work. And it didn't at the last minute. And so like my mom calls me afterwards. She's like, look, you know, they were wonderful. They they heard us out. We have no idea which way they're going to go with this. And so I was like, I get it. I get it. I haven't gotten my hopes up about this in a decade. And so it was a couple months after the Super Bowl. We're in Kansas City. And I get a call from my mom and she's like, she's like, they we you got your music. And so sorry that this is it's literally been so long since this happened. It's every time I talk about it, she's like, you got you got your music. And I just like very dramatically hit the floor for real. Like, honestly, just started a long time bawling my eyes out. And I'm just like, just just weeping and kind of like unable. I was just like, really? Really? Really? What do you mean? What do you mean? I'm like, get yourself together, get your shit together. Like, just go tell Travis in a normal way. And I knock on the door. He's playing video games. And I'm trying to say it in a normal way. And I'm just like. Travis! Oh, no. What just happened? What just happened? And he's like, he like puts his head down. He's like, guys, gotta go. And I think he thought something was wrong. And you come up and I'm just like. I got all my music back. And then just start absolutely heaving. Just deadweight. Just deadweight. Dropped. Had no power in my legs to support myself. And yeah, this changed my life. I can't believe it still. Every time I think about it, it's like I have to tell the short version to everyone because it is still like this. This will affect the rest of my life. I think about this every day now, but instead of it being like an intrusive thought that hurts me, it's I can't believe this happened. How lucky am I? How grateful am I? I'm so grateful to like the artists that helped me with my re-records, because when I did my re-records, I started doing those in 2021. And a lot like most of the industry trades were like, this is a bad idea. This is her sort of derailing her career in a way nobody's interested in you doing the same album twice. Fans are not going to be engaged with this. This is not going to go well for her. Somebody knew though. And it was like I still was able to like reach out to friends of mine like like like Phoebe Bridgers, Keith Urban, Marin Morris, Chris Stapleton, you know, Haley Williams from Paramore, Fall Out Boy, like all these absolutely incredible artists that like shape who I am as an artist. And they like agreed to be a part of the re-records. And I like, you know, I one of the only people I told before this happened was like I called Phoebe Bridgers and I was just like, And she's like, I think you just did you just say what I think you said? And so this has just been like it was just I'm so grateful for it. It's it's just unbelievable. And I was so happy you were there when that happened. I mean, I was because I could not stand. Yeah, I mean, I started crying too. You know, I'm a weeping. I was just so happy for you because I've seen I've seen how you make music. I've seen how you make these videos, seen the effort and the focus and the strategy behind what just one album in Torture Poets Department and and and then Fortnight and I was blown away that you had been doing this your entire life. And for, you know, your first six albums, you weren't given the rights to all of that. And I know what that that looked like. And I know how much it burns you that that you didn't have that and you didn't have your creation. And I just I think doing it the right way, creating the fan base that you did the right way and and and leading your audience. And and leading your life in a direction that you you were eventually going to get it back somehow some way because of you always doing things with the right intentions. So so how I guess how does music owners. This is so crazy to me. So you wrote these songs, you sang these songs, you put everything into them. And don't get me wrong, there's publishing companies, people that support artists out there. But yeah, how how does ownership of music even work? Like when you recorded these songs when you were 16, right? Is that like you've done it down to us? Ninety percent. The singer gets a certain portion. The the artist gets us or the songwriter gets a certain portion and then the publishing company gets a certain portion. OK, so this is that's a great question. And there's two main categories that we're talking about here. So Master Recordings is the actual recording. Yes, it's the actual vocal band production, mixing, mastering that actual thing. Yes, mine. Mine also included my album artwork, my music videos, everything that went along with any era of music that I had done for my first six albums. Every year. So then there's also then there's another category, which is publishing. I own my publishing, which is why, you know, I have control over, you know, if my song is used in a film, I and I and I wanted them to use Taylor's version instead of the original version. I, the songwriter, can decide that. Got it. OK. You know, and so it's like I basically I've always been very lucky because my publishing was protected. A lot of artists have have their publishing sold away from them or they sell their publishing. And I, you know, and a lot of artists, it may not be important to them. It was always important for me. The publishing aspect of it has always been something I've had firmly in place, which is great because my songwriting is the core of why I do this, why I love it so much and what I think has made anything happen in my career at all. Greatest songwriter of all time. That's very nice of you to say that. It's like says her boyfriend says a lot of people. Basically, then you have the master recordings side of things. Now, this is a discussion that was not really brought up amongst the artists communities, especially not with fans. This was all kind of industry centric and kind of boring contract stuff that like fans were not speaking about. And so one thing that I think is really great that has come about because of this is that I have so many new artists come up to me now and say, hey, I didn't even know this was a thing. And when I went to go and negotiate for my record deal, I negotiated to have my masters revert back to me after a certain amount of years or that I own them outright. And it's not for everyone. Not everyone cares about this artist to artist artists have different priorities. Some artists sell off all their masters because everyone's allowed to have their own priorities. What I wanted, though, is that if I were to put the information out about what I went through, at least it gets artists talking about this to decide whether this is a priority for them. Because you can't know if it's a priority for you unless you know what has come before you and what has happened. And so the master recordings thing, that's your actual ownership of your recordings. To put it in perspective, if I never would have been able to buy back my music, one day someone else would be leaving all of my music from my first six albums to their kids in their will. Right. Yeah. And you think about it like that. It's like I thought of it. I made it. I recorded it. I paid for most of those music videos. You know, I wanted an opportunity to buy that back. And that was important to me. You feel like they're yours. They should be yours. Yeah, exactly. Do you think it was easier for you to do one because you're I mean, just you talking about this, you're so aware of the business side of this and the legal realm of like you're more aware than I think probably most artists are. But being in the world, it's crazy. Being a songwriter, the smartest woman in the world. You being the songwriter, being the singer, owning no publishing rights, being able to rerecord songs that gave you leverage and able to make this move. Right. Yes. Yeah. Yes. So that was it. And also, you know, in my contract, they didn't put a clause in that said I couldn't rerecord because nobody was doing it and nobody thought that was a good idea. Right. So and also like who would be that stubborn? Like who would be who would be that petty? This badass kid over here. They would record every single thing. It's so badass. Over and over again. What was your favorite one? Not just that. Hold on, not just that. Who has a fan base that's going to listen to the same album twice in a row? It's a good point, Jason. It's a good point. Honestly, and this is where they missed it. You had this diehard community that you had already built. That's the thing is the fans are. You told a story with the second time you released this album, right? And the fans got behind that narrative. And they're like, screw the first album. We're rolling with the rerecorded album because we're supporting the artists. They were like, we ride at dawn. And it was it was amazing because, you know, they're the reason why the rerecords worked out. They're the reason I was able to purchase my music back because they came to the Aeros tour. And basically, they're the reason why any of this worked out. And I also want to note that, like the other people who are like, we ride at dawn, my my live band, they played on all the rerecords. It's like you want to know why they sound so perfect on the Aeros tour. They played they played on all those records like their session musicians, too. And that's how good they are. And I'm I'm so impressed just by their ability and their dexterity as musicians to be able to do that so convincingly because they're they're they're actually some there's the the Taylor's versions on. I kind of refer a lot of that stuff. I think it sounds incredible, but I'm happy to have all of it. So that leads me to the next question today. Now that you own all of it, you have the rerecordings, you have the original recordings. What should we listen to? Like, what do I do? I roll. It doesn't matter. You're just like whatever you guys want. It's really whatever you guys want. I love both of them. I would not have put out the rerecords if I didn't think that they held up or were better. I think a lot of the vocals I did on the rerecords are better than the originals. Okay. But it's like if you found a nostalgia in the originals and that was what you were listening to when you were 12 years old bopping around in your bedroom. Go crazy. Yeah, we got them all. I'm going to start doing comparisons. That's what I got to do. I just got to start doing comparisons. Yeah, you're going to listen to every beat. You're certainly not mandatory, Jason. I mean, it sounds like a good time. I'll say this. There's a few good playlists out there that have a mixture of them all. You've been streaming? Yes. I've been streaming for about two years now. Oh, that's fantastic. Thank you so much. That's why we got that spike in the 35-year-old male demographic. Yes, that 1.7 billion. That was at least 1 billion. We have one IP address from one iPhone that continually is listening to this. Did you have a favorite album that you rerecorded? Are there different eras that you liked recording more? I really liked them all, but I think Red was very special. There were songs that I called From the Vault songs, and there was one which I think is maybe my favorite song I've ever written called All Too Well, the 10-minute version, where I unearthed... There were originally so many more verses in that song than ended up being on the album that I had put out when I originally put out Red. I made the glorious, fortuitous mistake of saying that to my fans in an interview. You know what those words mean. I love it. You're so handsome. So basically, I said that in an interview to my fans, and they just hung on to it. They were like, where's the 10-minute version? Give us the 10-minute version. Yeah. And when it came time to doing Taylor's version and rerecording the album, I went back in, found the verses, restructured the song to the way that it pretty much was when I had originally written it, put them back in. And that song is one of my favorite things I've ever done. And it was when we were on the Eras Tour, I'm watching people just cathartically scream this song to the point where I'm like, do you need to go to the hospital? It was so passionate, the fan response to that song at the Eras Tour. And I remember thinking so many times, what if this never happened? What if I never had to record this? It's one of the most iconic parts of that tour. It was so fun. And so yeah, it really did make me fall back in love with that album specifically. I have a song with Phoebe Bridgers that I really love on that, from the vault. Chris Stapleton was a part of it as well. And I just, I think that one, I've always loved Fearless in 1989 in a very pure way. But Red, I've kind of gone back and forth over the years and been like, you know, like that rerecording, it made me just be like, God, I love that album. I have no complicated feelings about that. I wouldn't have done anything different. Maybe except to include the original verses the first time. Well, let's, we just talked about the different eras a little bit. Let's talk about perhaps the most daunting thing that any artist has ever taken on, which is the eras tour. Oh my God. You finally finished it up last December in Vancouver. I don't know. What did it feel like to wrap it up? What does it feel like now? Like not touring and being on a jet every day, basically trying to go from country to country. Yeah, I mean, it feels great, Jason, to be honest. I'm not going to lie to you. You don't miss it? I miss it. I do miss it, but it's like it was perfect for what it was. Do you know what I mean? And it was a lot of, it was a lot of physical therapy and it was a lot of like being in a state of perpetual physical discomfort. Kind of like when you're in season, you know? Yeah, no. I'm not getting hit by huge 300 pounders, but the heels. No, when I saw the recovery station in the hotel room after with the toe spacers. I got an acupuncture in that. I'm telling you, dude, the similarities were crazy. I'm like, oh my gosh, she does more than I do. We're like comparing physical therapy stories like recovery stuff. Have you ever tried taping your ankles? We related on how much. Yeah, I miss it because I miss the fans and I miss that connection. But at the same time, it was so special. It was like the most formative time of my life. I learned so much about about how far I can push myself. And if I set a goal, you know, making that a three and a half hour show in the beginning of the tour, it's like you can't like be sick one day and then decide tonight. It's going to be two and a half hours. And it's really just like prioritizing the fans experience before before anything else. And my fellow broken heart. Yeah, don't get me started. Don't you get me started or like stomach flu or like just like aching feet or blisters or whatever. Like it's it just which she had all of this going through all at the same time. But when you tour fourth show. Yeah. And it's just it was kind of the coolest thing in the world because when we were putting together this tour, I had some really lofty goals I wanted to reach conceptually because I wanted to show. I wanted to show fans and especially younger fans visuals and sort of performance art references that were really important to me as a kid and what inspired me to want to do this. Right. So like I wanted to put elements of musical theater Broadway ballet, you know, scenery that you would see in an opera kind of things like this. I watched the whole tour. I don't I just thought it was amazing. But that's that's exactly it. I wanted it to be references that I thought were really high concept and really high value for fans and for them to see things they hadn't necessarily seen before all in one concert. But I wanted to do it at at the highest intensity rapid fire. You're seeing something new every 15 to 30 seconds. And so it feels like you're scrolling in an algorithm. Right. And when I heard reports of people saying that they got actual amnesia after the concerts, I was like, Oh, I think we did it. Yeah, I think I think we did it. Nailed it. That's that's genuine. That's I didn't even wasn't even shooting for that goal when they're like, I saw so many things and I experienced a state of euphoria that I now don't remember what happened to me. I was like, Oh, my God. All I remember is that she didn't want to meet me. That's it. That's all he got about. And as much as much as you and I've told you this as much as you want to, you know, give New Heights credit, I give the heirs to her credit. Yeah, I give the heirs to her credit because if I would have never gone to that show and then mesmerized and just been captivated. Yeah. And then left with such a desire to want to meet you. I would have never went on here and told everybody how butthurt I was. Yeah, I'd never just been so engulfed in the curiosity of who you were. Oh, that's really, really, really best things about that last statement is you didn't even know what the word engulfed meant before. Like you met Taylor like this is you're broadened your horizons so far. It were the perfect. I'm telling you. It's so she makes me so much better. Thank you for saying that. Thank you for saying that. But it's like you see you on the stage and you see how crazy you can get an entire stadium going. And then I get you in a room and it's like I've known you forever. It's like it was just the easiest conversation I ever had. And it was just so much fun that it just it knocked my socks off from what they say. Knocked your socks off. Yeah. Thank you. That's I felt she blew me away. And I had never I had never experienced something so mesmerizing on stage and then so real and so beautiful in person. Hey, that's should I leave? Yeah, I think so. Honestly, at this point, I think everyone should leave. I don't know where to go from here now. What? How many countries did you do the Ares Tour in? Forty seven thousand countries, Jason. You just listed that in the beginning. I said 51 cities, which I don't know if that's right. It was a lot of countries. What was really fun about all the countries that we went to is when we first started dating, he was like, I always wanted to go and really vacation in Europe and see Australia and, you know, go to Asia. And I was like, well, I got I got a tour for that. You know, it's coming up. Oh, nice. You got room for a six five guy. We can figure it out. Like, no, that's it. The dimensions are wild, but we'll make some room. I think we'll have to leave some some equipment. Thank you for the size. But but absolutely would be happy to have you. We got to, you know, we got to travel the world and have vacations and adventures when I wasn't on stage, which was really fun because like Europe was so fun. Australia is amazing. Yeah, it was great. And and that entire part of our lives, like I was on tour for so long and now I finally am not on tour. And it's it's kind of great because I'm getting my hobbies back. Like when I was on tour, all I had the bandwidth for was what's the acoustic mashup this week? What how do I say welcome to the Airis tour in Portuguese? You know, that was the only thing taking up my brain space. And now it's it's been so fun to see what Taylor actually gets into around. It's like I'd say all my hobbies could be categorized as like hobbies you could have had in the seventeen hundreds. You know, like I get on my grand. You enjoy doing all of these homey things. That's basically what you're saying. Yeah, I like to sew. I specialize, as you know, in children's purses and baby blankets. I make two things. I know that very well. Very good at these two things. I love to paint. I love to cook. I have a different baking obsession every six months. I'm the luckiest man in the world right now. Right now, we're we're very deep in a sourdough obsession that is taking over my life. I am aware. Yeah, and I'm very deep in it now. You've got a deep in this. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I'm working as much as I am and running as much as I am because I am I'm getting the caloric intake. Yeah, he asked me to send him two loaves of sourdough at training camp. I'm like I'm like wrapping sourdough loaves in like like saran wrap or whatever. Like like cling film. The sourdough is taking over my life in a huge way. I'm really talking about bread 60 percent of the time. It's it's become it's become a huge, huge factor. I mean, and she's getting good with making all these different versions of it. Yeah, my favorite one was probably I mean, the regular sourdough is one of my favorites, but the blueberry. Yeah, we do. There's a blueberry lemon. There's cinnamon swirl, cinnamon raisin. And this one I've been workshopping for the girls because they love everything. Rainbow Fun Fetti sourdough. Oh my gosh. Yes. No, it will. They love sprinkles like we put, you know, we put sprinkles in everything when we hang out. Yeah. It's really. Yeah, she's a loafer for life now. Yeah. And it's it's gotten it's gotten pretty crazy over here. I'm just like always like baking bread and texting my friends and being like, can I send you some bread? I need some feedback. Do you like this one better than you liked the other one? Like I did the rise a little differently. I'm on like sourdough blogs. There's a whole there's a whole community of us and I didn't know. Oh my gosh. This is an amount of people hoping that you're on their blog. Oh, I'm sorry. Girl, I'm on your blog. But it's like I just didn't know this. There's people like me out there and this is where the Internet is good. This is where the Internet is a good place where you can curate a reality where like all I really use the Internet for is sourdough. And when Travis shows me videos of otters on his Instagram algorithm, I want to wild. I want a wild otter so bad. I just want to like find these little creatures. Yeah, he does. But he wants wild one. Why wouldn't you? Aren't they all wild? No, there's domestic. He wants one specifically whose life he saved. Who knows that he saved his life. It's a really specific type of otter he's looking for. The videos that I watch are somebody just in a canoe. Yeah, he doesn't want to like go up to an otter and take it from its mother. He wants to see an otter and the otter is like my paw is caught in a shell. And he's like, I got you. And then the otters like, thank you forever with its little paws and then it swims up and then it's and you're kayaking and it's like doing this to you. Like, that's what he wants. And I want it to honestly. Who doesn't? Who doesn't? Yeah, right. Yeah. So do otters eat bread? Can we get a sourdough eating otter that might be perfect? We're going to figure it. We're going to figure that out. I don't know if they do. They're probably. But yeah, we had discussed maybe like carrying around cans of sardines just in case we run into one. Nice. It's better in principle than it is in practice. Easier to conceptualize. It seems pretty easy though. You just got to go canoeing. Which is also easier in principle than it is in practice for us in terms of just the weight balance. I'm on the hunt for a friend. Yeah. Stuff you didn't know you needed to know, right, Jason? I mean, I love otters. I don't know who doesn't love watching Instagram Otters. This is what life after eras tour is though, Jason. You got to. It's so crazy. I'm retired. I am all in on this. I want to bake. I just don't have the planning behind it. Taylor's a planner and she's going to have the sourdough alive. We're not going to keep a sourdough alive. I've folded. What is it? I've. What's the. He's actually done it. He's actually done it. Yeah, I've made a loaf. You've had one of my loaves actually. He's done. He's done all of it. I've actually got a station. We've set it up where it's like, I've got a station and he's got a station and he's done all of it. Okay. So he's actually baked too. I've stretched and folded before. Yeah. But there's just like something always slightly. I've weighed all the flow. No, his was actually higher than mine. His was more delicious than mine. It's like, it's also, you know, no directions over here. I get into the old chance. Jason, you've had it and you said you loved it. I'm not saying it's not good, but it's no way as good as Taylor's. That's not true. I'm telling you, if you took like two chunks and you sent it off to the lab, there's going to be so many more germs and microbes. Oh my God. Oh, the bacteria count. What is the fungus in this? That's the sour Jason. Why is there chest hair in it? How did you? Yeah, there's like, the aprons too low. There's like chest hair in his, there's cat hair in mine. Both of these are completely inedible. But it's crazy how you can, how many puns you can make. Cause I do the whole, I got bread bags and I got labels. And so it's, you can, you can really go for it with the puns. You go, are you ready for it? Are you ready? Flower song is the slamming screen door. That's horrible. It's a loaf story. Baby, just say yeast. Just say yeast. Yeah. What's what's what's what's a loaf story. No, it's horrible. Loafing him was bread. It's bad. You don't know that song. And that's okay. It wasn't on the tour. So we do have this. I did fuck that up. 21 countries. Did you learn anything throughout the play? Is there anything at the end of the tour when you were wrapping up that you wish you had been doing the whole time? Is there anything you would do differently now that the entire tour is wrapped up? No, I, I, I'm really glad that I didn't know it would have gone on as long as it did. Um, I'm, I'm glad that I got to like actually be prepared for this tour the way that I was because, you know, in previous tours, I had noticed that I would get on the tour and I'd have to like get my stamina up throughout the tour. And by the last quarter of the tour, I'd finally hit my stride stamina wise and I'd be like, oh, I can do this easily every night. Yeah. I wanted to be at that point at the beginning of the errors tour. So that's why I did so much more training, so much more endurance training and, and cardio and stuff that, you know, doesn't come naturally because I'm not an athlete. So it's like that stuff I have to really force myself to do. Don't you say that. I mean, don't you dare say that. It's how I feel. And I don't even, it's not like I say that in a disparaging way. I, I, I don't care at all. Um, but I just, why do we, why do we take it that way? I don't know. Yeah. I'm like, I, I really, I'm not an athlete and that's fine. Like I play instruments. I take it that way because we're undefeated on the beer pong table. Um, I've seen you throw a football. No, that's not good. And you know, that's not good. It does. No, it does. You can no spiral. Yes. You, you gotta, you gotta be really, because it's not, there's no spiral. I don't think I've ever caught anything that's ever been thrown to me near me around me. That's true. Can you hit something with a stick? Um, that's a telltale sign of an athlete. Good. I don't know, Jason. We, I've never tried that. So it's like, we're going, we're going out. My relationship with sports was like, you know, I grew up in Pennsylvania. I always heard my dad yelling at the screen, watching Eagles games. That was always the sports sounds that I heard in my house. However, I was up in my room playing guitar, learning instruments, playing piano. Just I was focused on different things. I was like so laser focused on music and that's how I was in school. Like I, I would go to sporting events so that I could sing the national anthem. Like everything was a means to an end to get me to get to do music. I know every halftime show from the super bowls, but I don't, I didn't watch the sports. And so watching the airs tour and seeing that power skip, I knew you were an athlete from the, from the, from the power. You're just saying it's one of my favorite parts. Just see you just skipping down that runway. Just looking like a giraffe. That's limbs were put on all wrong. Not everybody can, everybody can skip, but not everybody can power skip. That takes athleticism. Thank you. What do you need compliment? So yeah, I, I, I definitely became obsessed with sports when it came to him. I'm competitive on his behalf, but like if you and me are going to go against each other in something athletic, like I'm going to let you win. Cause this to me, like, I don't see why. What did the points even mean? If I'm, if I'm doing it, I'm a fan of athletics and the sports, if I'm doing the sports, like I'm throwing like this because I don't what, I don't really care if it goes where it's supposed to go. It doesn't bother me. And when I don't make the catch, I'm not embarrassed. That's fine. She's a good teammate. So she'll, she'll give effort. If you, if it's team, if it's individual sports, she's not going to care. But if she needs to be held accountable, if I'm on his team and we're playing beer pong or something, like I'm really trying your team sports, this matters to him. Right? Absolutely. I'm a team sports gal. Put me, put me on an Olympic one person trying to do some stuff sport. I'm doing this. Yeah, I don't care. I'm getting out of here. Yeah, I'm, I'm doing this. I care. Okay. I'm doing this. I care. This care a lot. We're doing this. We're kneading dough. I don't, I don't care. Stretching. I don't care if this happens. I don't care if this goes here. It's not part of my metrics for my self-worth. All right. That's probably very healthy. To be honest with you. Hey, you know, I was like, as long as you're fine with this. What? No, I'm completely fine with you being an athlete. Yeah. I'm not an athlete. I'm never going to be. I think you just missed the whole point. Yeah. What? He sees what he wants to see and it bodes well for me. Do you have a favorite thing from the Eris Tour? I have a lot of favorite things from the Eris Tour. I would look out and I would see a lot of bonding happening between generations of people. Gosh, that's so true. It was really wonderful. It was like the most incredible feeling in the world because I can see all that. I've got LASIK. I have incredible vision. Basically, the Eris Tour, I think one of my favorite things was when the fans would come up with their own traditions, right? Because I can plan a stage show that's like, we know exactly what's happening, when it's going to happen. It's very stage managed. It's a whole production, right? And I love to plan. But I also do love surprises. There's a time during the European Eris Tour, there's a song called Willow where we do a performance where we have these, it's a very witchy performance. We have these light up orbs and we're in cloaks and it's all very woo. The fans decided that they were going to bring their own light up orbs. By that, I mean balloons that they would blow up in the audience. And then they would use their phone light behind it and create a light up orb. And I tell you, I looked out, yeah, or a glow stick, whatever. They would figure out ways to illuminate themselves. And it was insane to look out and see spontaneously thousands of these orbs just go up. And I just feel like, I don't even know who organized this. Was there a group text? How did you guys even do this? It was so special. It felt like we were all part of something together in a way that couldn't be planned. And there's as much as I love and relish in planning, it was really fun that they would do things to sort of delight me every once in a while. They had little chance. They had all these traditions. By the end of the tour, it was like Rocky Horror Picture Show where they have their own choreography. They have their own show, literally. Right. I remember being in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. And you know what? What did you just say? Gelsenkirchen? Love is him learning that. Yeah. That's her actual, that's a city? He came to Gelsenkirchen and supported me there. If you say with a German accent, it probably sounds more like the actual city. But my American accent is Gelsenkirchen. And I remember seeing that part of the show and they were literally doing circles and like putting the orbs up in the air and passing them to each other like they were performing. It was so beautiful. It was crazy. They were so committed. I've never, I've never played for crowds that were as committed. Yeah. I think I love the event of it. Like I'm always, I'm always trying to figure out how to make music into more of an event. Right? How do we make it romantic? How do we make it something that people experience together? And you know, that's why I love vinyl. That's why I love, you know, putting so much into the tour or a music video or events or activities for them to do or Easter eggs or little puzzles for them to solve. It's gotten to the point where it's just like, it's a little bit, people are like, the Easter eggs thing is getting a little zodiac killer at this point. I'm like, as long as they like it, you know, how do you go about like knowing how to do an Easter egg? I don't even know. Like, where does that process start? Are you like, well, I have some parameters. What is the art of the Easter egg? The art of the Easter egg is that there's, there's do's and don'ts, right? I'm never going to plant an Easter egg that ties back to my personal life. It's always going to be towards music or a musical, something I'm coming up with, something I have coming up, a plan I have coming together. Something that you don't know I'm saying for a specific reason that you'll hear later and you'll go back and be like, oh my God, like, I think my favorite one of those was I, I was given an honorary doctorate from NYU and I made the commencement speech and I put so many lyrical Easter eggs in that speech that when the Midnight's album came out after that, the fans were like, the whole speech was an Easter egg. Yeah. And that's for me, that's really fun because I because they find it fun for sure. And also just I love numerology. I love math stuff. I love dates. I love certain, I just that stuff like I find really fun. And, you know, we I want Easter eggs to be a certain thing where like if you are a part of the fandom and you want to experience like music in a normal way, then then you don't even see these. You don't even care what that thing is above that doorway in under that dimly lit flickering light over there that's upside down backwards in Braille. I do. You don't you don't need to know what that is. Yeah. But if you want, if you want to look at that. But if you do, then it's there. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like, if you know, you know, you know, you know. Oh, yeah. What's then you know, then you know, let's talk about something I don't know. What is numerology? You threw that phrase out there like that's a comment. What is numerology? You don't know what numerology is. I'm assuming something with numbers. Yeah. Like I'm 87 and she's 13. Yeah. Literally, it's that simple. Just numbers and 100. Yeah. 13 plus 87 equals 100. That's numerology. Like numbers, numbers that have a specific significance. Like, yeah, exactly. Yeah. Do you not keep it 100 ever? I'm trying to attempt to. It's crazy that you don't. What numbers do I have? Not like that. Kylie, I don't know how to do this. It's OK. It's not for everyone. My favorite numbers 13, though, it always has been Travis. I know. And that's part of the numerology of why we're dating. OK, part of it. OK. It's been in my life. Right. I was Travis likes people that like the number 13. Yeah. I love liking the number 13 say about us, though. It says that we're family in. OK. In trichodectophilia, I think it is, is the what the session with. No, it's every day, dude. This is that's a real thing. I don't know what that means. This is every day. You know, trick, trick, Delphophilia. So that's the obsession with specifically number 13 or so. I'm sorry. Yeah. Trichodect, Trichodectophobia is when you hate 13. Trichodectophilia is when you love it. Philia is love. I don't know why I do it. It was like everybody else was afraid of number 13. So I'm like, yeah, that's phobia. That's OK. Yeah. You're just being contrarian, which I love. I love that about you. All right. Well, you're just like, you want to do this? I'm going to do this. That's exactly how I sound. Oh, Jason. Let's get Jason, Jason, Jason. All right. Favorite, favorite thing about the heirs to her was besides going to it and just being like this amazed at everything. I think I was on another podcast recently, just like. All of the songs, everything you just talked about where it changes so much. Right. There's something new every 20, 30 seconds. It was incredible. The nonstop length of it. But I will I'm going to be remissed if I don't say one of the things that I love is watching Travis Kelsey get on the stage, the man in the tuxedo. It was so good. It was so special. That was like we were like that came out because we were just do it. We thought we were doing a bit like we both thought we were just joking because a lot of what we're saying is like inside of a bit. And we're laughing the whole time. And everyone, so I want to be like, are you serious? Like I I could be. I'm I could be serious. Are you serious? Like I was I was serious in. And in terrifying fashion, I was like, yeah, it was like a one. Wouldn't it be funny if kind of thing? And I would try not to fuck this up. It was so the show's perfect. You don't want to fuck the show up, do you? But I knew you were going to be down for I knew you were if you wanted to do it. Like I was never going to pressure you to do it. But the fact that when when we were talking about it, we were joking. I kind of got I saw that little twinkle in your eye where I was. Oh, he wants to do it. You want me to he wants to do it. He wants to do you want me to go on stage? Yeah. You got up there. You were so good. Every single beat, his comedic timing is crazy. Like and when the lights are bright, he's like he like slows down time. Like that's when he. Well, no, I just black out and hope that it ends out like perfect. That's what you said. You and I are saying the same thing. I did. I think, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, like I I rose from that stage and I saw how many people are looking at you. It's just like. Blackout, you looked so good. It was so amazing. Like it was it was one of the loudest, if not the loudest screams I've ever heard on the tour. It was insane. It really was. How many have you played football in some of the biggest stadiums? You've been in front of people, but started your life. What was that moment like? There's nothing like this. Were you like an aunt? I felt like the smallest piece of life ever, like that entire stadium, the floor of what are all these people doing on the field? How are holy? I didn't know this place felt like this. Oh, my gosh. What is going on? I have to pick her up now. OK, here we go. Don't drop her. Don't drop her. It's so funny that you were actually scared about that. You could like throw me over a mountain. I'm like climbing the mountain and you catch me on the other side. Football players drop balls all the time. It's not a hit. Oh, my God. It was so good. It was it was London. It was Wembley Stadium. It was those were such special shows. And we had just wasn't this the week that I got to watch Jason meet the royal family? It was it was. Yeah, I knew you were serious when I was like, Jason, do you want to go meet? He was like, what do I do with my beer? Yeah, I watched him have this moment with his beer where he's just like, but I want to take it. But I know that I I probably should not take it. I watched this happen and it was kind of the most amazing. When I meet, I like to pick up on it because that was exactly what I don't. Like if I don't have my beer, what do I do with this hand now? Disrespectful to have a beer. Yeah. Or am I just like being being authentic by having the beer? I would normally have the beer, wouldn't they want me to be myself? I'm watching you say that in your head. And it was fantastic. I don't know. I always remember that. I was just just like, I'll always remember me for the first time. Do we need to talk about that? That's how I get hold onto my beer. You did. What was I guess you brought it up? What was that first impression like? What was did you know I was told to be on my best behavior? I didn't know what you were told, but I did know that one of the first things I saw was like you say to Kylie, I was just shotgunning beers with the Bills mafia and I really want to go through one of the fire tables. Yeah, I want to jump through it. I want to jump onto the flaming table. And she goes. OK, can we not do that right now? And since then, I've heard her say that exact thing to your four year old about like, mommy, I want to throw this pudding on the wall. Wouldn't that be fun? Can we not do it right now? That's a common phrase. And so I meet you. You're exactly as I thought you would be. Kylie is exactly as I thought she would be, just like the realist, the smartest, the coolest. You're fantastic. Obviously, you know that. And then I swear to God, Jason, you flew through the window at light speed. I've never seen someone so big move so fast. It's impressive. It's like, you know, you see a cricket and it's here. And then it's gone. And it's 16 feet that way. You're like, did it just jump that way? How did it do that? And he surprisingly he gets more athletic, the more more beers. I mean, it's real. It was wild. I really should have played in the NFL. I think it would have been better. You know what? Not know. At this point, I would never argue with that. And all of a sudden, like you're out there in the snow. You're handing me children through the window. Like trying to. That's fully not my best moment. It was and I think it actually was. And I'm like, you want to see Taylor? I got you. Let's go. Whose kid is that, Jason? Do you know where this kid came from? Yeah, it was. I think it was your best moment. And I think I'm very lucky to have gotten to see it. I love this like new world that Travis has shown me because I really. It's so fun. It's so exciting. There's so much pressure on these players that I didn't. I kind of was like, I've I've only ever been in music and been like, you know, seeing that, but the pressure on sports is just such a different type that I have such a respect for everyone, like everyone I meet on his team, like everyone I see doing this, I'm just like, you've been focused on this since you were a kid and it shows. Well, and I'm sure there's a lot of relatability there. Anybody trying to be the best of what they do and dedicating their lives to it. I mean, yeah, yeah. I've been I've been so lucky because I never have gotten to see what the suite looks like when I play the game. I never get to see my friends and family. I never get. So now whenever I make it, I get to see what it actually looks like, how much fun they're having, what, you know, the type of support that I get and how crazy it gets. So the Vegas Super Bowl, there was there was a camera on the suite. And when Nicole scored that touchdown and to see everybody in that suite start jumping on each other, our body slamming each other into other rooms, it was so violent. It's giving me the chills. Like everybody. I'm the I'm the luckiest guy in the world that video to get everybody going crazy. People went down like there were there people punching each other. It was like absolute chaos. And like I have I have every memory of that, like every memory of that moment is intact. But it's just like screaming and thrashing around and trying not to be taken down by this undertow of your friends going absolutely. I loved every bit of it. Oh, it was so insane. I mean, the suite that is the Travis Kelsey suite that has been happening. What was your first impression of that, of everybody in there? Who's the MVP of the suite? Who's the MVP of the suite? OK, so he's got which is an incredible like a huge green flag is that Travis has had the same friends since he's probably four years old. Yes, literally. And he's incredibly good at maintaining friendships. And he's so loyal and his friends are equally loyal. And they're just the funniest, most hilarious group of people. Yeah. And you want to talk about green flags. The first game she went to, the Bears game, she literally went through the front door of the stadium. We walked right in just right in like the tick, like general admission through general admission through with the everybody on the bus to the game. Oh, my gosh. I was just like, oh, she's just in it. She's down. She's down for the ride. She's here. She's here for the fun. She's like, I'll fucking go through the mud. I'll be a part of a cheese kingdom. Like this is where we walk in. This is where we walk in. I don't know what to tell you. I don't have an alternative. I'm like, you know, we just played here three months ago. Yeah. And we went a different way. But I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to backseat drive this shit. What was that like? What were people doing? I remember using like Ross was like Ross is so tall and so and so broad that it's like that that helps a lot. And then just you have a lot of other just like big bulky dudes that you're friends with. Green flag not threatened by other guys. I was walking in with I had a hat on and I had a mask on. And I'm walking in just in the front where we're walking in with thousands of people in Arrowhead and nobody nobody noticed. Oh, my gosh. There were rumors that we had been seeing each other, but I think people were like, what would they talk about? Yeah, you know. Yeah. I hit it on the Pat McAfee show that I was going to see if you would be willing to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead. Yeah. Since I saw you make the stadium. Nobody was like, oh, yeah, we're definitely going to. We're definitely going to see her there and we're going to see her coming in through general admission. The way this guy landed her. No chance. No chance that whole podcast thing worked. I didn't believe it when you told me you manifested it. I did. You summoned me. Here I am. Andy Reed has recently revealed that he was the one who set you guys up. How true is this revelation by Big Red? Whatever Andy Reed says, we're going to stand by. We're not going to refute anything. He says it. Cupid. Big Red. It's all the same. That's what happened. He's he's been friends with my dad. My dad is is the most social man who's ever been born. Shout out to Scott. I was about to say, who's not friends with Scott? He's just like he's just a maniac. He will make a friend in an airport in 1971, have a five minute conversation and still be talking to that dude twice a week now. But he's like that with everyone he meets. If he has, he's able to have very many, very meaningful relationships. And it's a skill. It's a talent. It is. It is a mind boggling talent that I have only known him to have. Yeah. Yeah. He's a savant. It is a savant. Social savant. My dad. And so he knows Andy and, you know, and he's been coming to shows for years and stuff like that. So I've always had like a really positive vibe about Andy Reed. I didn't really know what what what the sports were that he was doing. But I knew that that was my dad's friend. And he knew he was really. I now know he is literally the most iconic, legendary coach of all time. And like from the way that you talk about him, his leadership style is so I respect it so much because I feel like it's done without like aggression or raising your voice or losing your composure. It's all very composed and focused. It can happen. He will rip you apart for sure. But like not in a. You got to be really like, but I feel like it's like he's called. Yeah, but that's the thing. It's like, but it's not done. It's not overdone. Right. Like, you know, from him, you know, you deserve it and you know, you know, that's what I heard. Exactly. And yeah, there's validity to it. There's like. There's so there's such a genuine like want to get better that him getting you to like do it the right way is is it's like a disciplinary thing. It's just like he he won't he wouldn't be doing it unless he saw the greatness in you or he saw your ability to get it right. And he wouldn't be doing it this way if it was any other way. If that makes sense. It does. There's a lot of heart. Yeah, there's there's a stoicism to which makes the heart when he shows it to you. And I think this is what you're kind of saying, Taylor. He's so like composed and so like locked in. And then all of a sudden, when he does show that little bit of like warmth, it's like, oh, here's the teddy bear. I see him. Yeah, he's funny. He's cheeky. Yeah. And then but it's like everything has a reason. Like everything is everything. Everything is very like intentional. He's like, I feel like he like coaches and lives in a very intentional way, which I think is really awesome. And it's just like a great leadership style. Yeah, there's a layer of trust and there's a layer of like discipline where you you're going to have some fun playing with form, but you're going to know when you got to flip that switch. You have to be serious and be on point and and do it his way. He says it all the time. He's got 51 percent. I was like, yeah, all right. Whatever you say, boss. I always feel like when you lose your shit, you lose your leadership. You know, for sure. It's just kind of something I've always kind of tried to administer. It's always what I'm doing. But he's a he's a huge role model for that is how he motivates people and how he does so without flying off the handle and is just very focused on what the right thing is at the right moment. You know. Yep. So what so did Andy tell Scott something? Is that what I'm trying to do? What did Andy say, Scott? I mean, OK, so when you guys did the full send on the podcast. Yes, it was. And he was like, you want to date me? And everybody heard it. It was the the shooting your shot heard around the world. Yes. Basically, everyone who likes you, which is a lot of people, started reaching out to everyone who knows me. There we go. I think it was like Andy was vouching for you. I think it was my my relatives, my cousins were like, please, please, please. He's amazing. There were there were friends that were like, he's actually an amazing guy. Like, he's so great. There was a lot of kind of people whispering in my ear about you. And I actually that's not normal. Yeah, it's not normal. There are people just willing to go to bat for you and be like, you don't understand this guy's incredible. Oh, Andy, well done. Yeah. Thank you, Andy. And Scott and Scott. Thank you. There we go, Scott. How speaking of which, how Scott doing? He's doing good. So he is doing incredibly well. My dad had an interesting summer. He actually had a quintuple bypass surgery. And that's a really intense surgery. Yeah. So it all happened really quick. He went in. I know he would want me to say this because he really like he learned a lot through this process. He's had a healthy, perfect EKG every year that he's gone in to get his physicals. Yeah. Perfect EKG. Yeah. But what what found his five hard blockages in his heart was a resting stress test. So he's been telling all his friends, you need to get the stress test because that's what's actually preventative. If you can find that earlier, you don't have to have a bypass surgery. You can you can sort out those blockages with stents and things that are a lot less invasive. So he finds out that he's got these blockages. They're like, this is we got to do this like tomorrow. Yeah. You you you shouldn't like we don't know how you walked in here, dude. This is crazy. So he was, of course, saying to our family, he was like, you guys are busy. I don't want you guys to have to like come in here. Like you and Austin are busy. Like just don't you don't have to do this. Like don't bring dad, the strong dad. That's right. He he said something about like when a cat is injured, it curls up around a tree and heals itself. I was like, Dad, cats don't have quintuple bypass. He tried to relate. You're just saying stuff now. That doesn't mean anything to me. And so I was like, OK, I'm not going to come there. All right. Like, yeah. So he wakes up from surgery and it's it's my mom, my brother and me and his best friend. And he comes out of surgery and he was he did like a comedy act, a comedy set for like 15 minutes. He was the funniest he's ever been. And he's funny. But he's like he he we didn't know how many blockages he had. And I was like, Dad, you had a quintuple bypass. You had five. That's crazy. It's more than we thought. And he's like, well, you see, I come from a very competitive family. And it was kind of wild because it was like it was very parent child reversal in a lot of ways. Like my brother and my mom and I were each taking shifts in the ICU and staying with them 24 seven. And I remember when I was a teenager, my parents would always the big fight we always had is I'd sneak my cell phone into my room and be talking to my best friend, Abigail, under the covers all night. And they'd be like, you have a test tomorrow. You need to rest. We're taking your phone, whatever. Yeah, I get to the hospital. My my brother will have done the night shift. And he's like, he's like, hey, you got to take his phone. I caught him FaceTiming his friends all night. He needs his rest. He needs to be sleeping. He's FaceTiming all night. It's like one of the main things you need is you need that your body to just like. Yeah. Cover. And I'm like, I'm not taking his phone. He'll get mad. He's like, I'm not taking his phone. You got to be the one to take his phone. I'm like, I'm not doing it. My mom's like, I don't want to do it. So we're just like, it's like we've got like our teen. We've got to take our teenage son's phone away from him because he's FaceTiming all night. He came out of surgery, tried to give guitar picks to all the nurses and doctors, but he wasn't wearing pants, didn't have pockets, hospital gown. You know, I'm like, I'm having these moments where I'm like, this dude built play sets and swing sets and cribs for me. I'm building his like I'm building his shower chair and his walker and his like bed that goes like this. Like it's just surreal, man. And you're like, you know, we just all moved in with him for the whole summer pretty much. And just, you know, because you can't you can't really walk on your own. You got a little harness for my dad, just like walking dad on his harness. And he was like the loveliest patient ever. He just kept saying thank you over and over again. So I was full of life, man. Yeah. She was appreciative that he that he caught it. And he still is. Yeah. You know, we had a lot. We had the face time with him last time we were together. And I was like, yeah, he hasn't changed a bit. This guy's still freaking got the energy going. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So like, Trav was hanging with him the other day. And he was like, so, sweetie, he says he's at 75 percent. And if this is 75 percent, I'm truly terrified of him. To give you the update, I'm probably at 85 to 90 percent. Yeah. So we still got a month. Yeah. So my dad's like my dad's like new arteries knew me. My mom, my mom has got a new knee. There we go. She's doing great. She's she's scampering around. We're not quite at scampering yet, but she's doing great. Yeah. This was just like the summer of my parental upgrades, like we're just upgrading the parents, making sure that they live to be at least one hundred and eighty six years old. Huge. Because they're two of my best friends and I just adore them. And it was actually one of the most special things that's ever happened to me. Like spending all that time with them this summer and getting to like you have those long talks that you don't have when it's like a small concentrated period of time. This is this is when I learned to do the sourdough. Right. My my parents friend, Tina, sends over a lot of Tina Tina. Sends over like the best loaf of bread I've ever had in my life to call it bread. Feels really honestly sort of like it's sort of minimizing what this was. It's my day. I'm like, I need to know what I need to know how to do this. I go over Tina's house. She teaches me how to do it. She gives me some of her starter. Life is never the same. All these things are happening in Florida. Travis is doing his training. He's like, look at him. Florida. Look at him. And he's so fast. He jumped so high. So this is our Florida summer. It's a hell of a drug. We we really Florida it up. How many people have come up to you guys and talking about or spoken about how much they've appreciated you being a part of the Chiefs and like their daughters all of a sudden being in the sports because I get it all the time. Yeah, I can't imagine how much you guys get it. How much the game has grown. It definitely feels like a lot of people say that to us, which is really kind because there was never a thought in either of our heads that that was going to be no idea. That was yeah, that was a pleasant surprise. Seeing all the little girls in the stands at games and you can see a proud father right there standing next to him. It's definitely been fun to see that like surprise. You know, I think a lot of like a lot of the women and girls, maybe they maybe they like watched one game to see me cheer on my boyfriend or whatever. But if they if they stayed, which is what people are saying based on the numbers, that's because the game is so great. And it's such an amazing, interesting thing to learn about. I will say it was it was cool to see the comparison of it all because she the way she runs her her tour her show her like team and everything like this very like team friendly. There are similarities in terms of her athleticism. Yeah, what she's doing for three hours. I mean, I was screaming I was screaming for 40 seconds during the intro. And I'm out of breath. That's what I'm saying. But the preparation it takes to get there. I got a whole regimen for you. Okay, we'll get you on the tour prep. It'll be great. Perfect. The goals that you set for yourself to achieve. Like it's very like there are there are some similarities that I thought you found like, I don't know, like fascinating that you kind of have that same regimen going into stuff. And I thought that was that was fun for me to at least see when I saw you on tour and saw how much of a of a team you guys were. On paper, like we actually kind of have a very similar job. Like our job is to entertain people for three plus hours in NFL stadiums. And it's like, when I'm there, it's called a dressing room. When Travis is there, it's called a locker room. For me, it's called a rehearsal for him. It's called a practice for him. It's called his coach for me. It's my mom. Yeah, so there will be time for like game game versus show, right? I'll be like, baby, how was the show game? How was the rehearsal? The practice, you know, field stage. They're the same thing. We just call them different things. Yes, exactly. It was cool to see the comparisons and how kind of I don't know both aligned and hurt how hard she works in the gym. We've been to the gym like numerous times and she works harder than me every time. That's crazy. You can like lift a car. Okay. He's just telling he's just saying that's just that's just saying words. That's one rep. That's one rep. This is what people can stretch more. That's what I can do more. Yes, I've heard about the we've talked about the treadmill walk in while you're doing the whole show and like all of that. We can't walk for four hours. Can't what's the last time you walk for four hours? Travis, I've never even tried that. I'm not stupid enough to try something like that. You kidding? My knees would be shredded. Oh my God. So one of the other things that's been crazy to witness is just the immediate attention, right? Like I think you play in the NFL. You think on that on the two of us. Okay. The media attention on your guys relationship on the amount of people that talk about it constantly the theories that are out there of which I'm probably way too invested in. What how do you guys handle all of the noise and chatter about everything that's going on in both of your lives? We we don't really I don't see a lot of things. I'm of the firm belief that like if you're basing your kind of if you're getting your feedback from the internet or from comments and stuff, like I just really think that like anything you put anything you feed your brain, it will internalize anything you feed the internet. It will kill. I've been in the music industry for 20 years. It's pretty hard to hurt my feelings at this point. She's a pro and it took me a little while to be a pro about it. I think I think and there's still some like wacko theories from the beginning that I was very like, oh no, like how is she handling this? I don't like the last thing I wanted to do is screw this up. So I'm like in my mind is like her being so calm, cool, collected and so just real and understanding about everything that's going on really made me grow up real fast in that in that aspect of things. But also I think the fact that you genuinely find a lot of online discourse to be truly hilarious. Absolutely. And that changes things for me because this course and truth, you know, find the humor, find the humor. If he's seeing things and he thinks it's funny and it doesn't even affect his day at all, like that's really completely bled into the way that I metabolize these things. It's at a point where like I can something can be about me. Like my name can be in the actual headline and it can still be none of my business. People can be out here. People might be out here doing too much. Just shaking ass doesn't mean I have to do a damn thing. Yeah, we live in such a social media moment where a lot of people's identities and they get their feedback from that. Right. Like and I'm a real constructive criticism guy. Like give me constructive criticism all day. I will take it. It'll fuel me. It's helpful. Right. But I have so many like friends or acquaintances or people were like, they'll see one comment they don't like and it will ruin their day. It'll ruin their night. Like, and I just want to say to them, like you should think of your energy as if it's expensive, as if it's like a luxury item. Not everyone can afford it. Like not everyone has invested in you in order to be able to have the capital for you to care about this. Right. Because like what you spend your energy on, that's the day. And it's so true. Right. Like it doesn't matter where you were. Like maybe you went to go get coffee today. Maybe you saw friends today. If you were obsessing over one thing that you saw, like you literally like saw some guy call you mid and this and you can't stop thinking about it. Dude, that's the day then. That's the night then. And so I just, I've been able to sort of mediate a really healthy relationship with not seeing a whole lot. To what you just said, too. Social media expounds every all this because everybody knows if they say one thing, but all of a sudden, if they put Taylor Swift attached to it, it's going to get a thousand more retweets and likes and hate comments or love comments or whatever. It's going to stir up tons of controversy. Totally. And I get this way all the time where I just recently like went into the facility with Cam Juergens and something was happening like in the social media world that I was like, why are people like upset at this person? This is bullshit. Yada yada. And Cam just hit me with like, are they really though? Or did just one person say something? Because I used to get the same way where I'd get upset. And then it took me like, actually, nobody really gives a shit about this. Jason's early Twitter. Yes. Oh, baby. Oh my gosh. Oh, baby. He had to get off. He had to. He had to literally step away. It hit me right between the eyes. Because he would respond to it. I wouldn't say everybody, but he wasn't shy of letting people know how he felt on Twitter. Oh, yeah. Based off of their comments. It was honestly Philadelphia. You guys know this. It was a treat and it's become a treat again now that he's back on because you'll have a friendly conversation. Well, Twitter used to be like a different thing, right? Look, you remember Twitter. You're like, I fed a squirrel ate a piece of bread. Didn't know they ate bread like that. I need to get back on Twitter. Now that there's auto correct, I need to get back on Twitter. Right. I'm like, I need a pair of scissors to open these scissors. I need to be good. We're just thinking things, right? It's like a different thing now. And it's kind of about like information is power, I guess, unless all of your information is geared towards you thinking that everything is about you. Because not everyone is ever thinking about one person all the time at any point. If your algorithm is giving you either criticisms of yourself or adulation or praise, you're creating an ecosystem in which you're the centerpiece of the table. And I just don't think that's healthy. That's not the way I want to move through the world. So I do detach from the internet in a huge way. Like I'm just not, I have never, I have had my comments disabled on Instagram for like 10 years now. And I don't miss it. I found that out after the Ares tour. Comments were going to be the first one. Dude, the problem is I get so mad. I then go and look at all the other comments and then Twitter just feeds me more. And dude, you're on Reddit. It's like, so we saw this like this. Boom, boom, boom. Yeah. Whereas I'm like, I don't know what this is, but get out of my office. It's on fire. My business is making music and taking care of my fans. And I have ways of monitoring what they want from me and how best to entertain them, which is my job. And everything else, I'm just sort of like, it's not my business. I have actual business that I need to run. Can you imagine if we just talked about what people said about our relationship? Because that if we talked about that, that would be all we talked about because there's so much chatter. It's like we're busy having an actual relationship. I want to hear sour sourdough bread puns. Yeah, and you will. And that's a promise. All right, let's get to the part of this show that I think is what everybody is going to be talking about. Do I get to say it? Do I get to say I get to say the two words? Yes. Well, I think we were going to try and this is what you can do whatever you want to. This is very much whatever within the framework of the podcast. I'm a fan of the podcast. Typically, we would allow the guests to say new news. Yeah, I want to do it. But with Zach Brown, we had another bit that we did. I don't know if you saw. I don't know if we can get back to this. I've forgotten everything that Zach taught me already. All right, let's just let the expert take care of this. I just wanted to scream it. Taylor, just Travis style. I think Taylor has a little bit of new news. She's a natural. She's a natural. It was as fun as I thought it was going to be. Oh, it was everything. It was everything and more. We did talk about Easter eggs earlier. Yeah. And at the very last heiress tour, you didn't take the lift. You did not. You went upstage and exited through an orange door. Why did you change the ending? So that's I'm happy you mentioned that. I'm about to say, Jason, did you see that fans? Did you see that the fans noticed this? Because I was pretty proud of them for noticing that. They know I just, yeah, I was surfing the internet and saw something. Yeah. So that was, I was pretty happy that they noticed that I was like, trained them well. So basically every night of the errors, everything happens with the reason Taylor's a planner. She's not just a random orange door. What's happening there? Why is why and why? Anyway, so I would leave the stage every night going down the elevator lift. That's how every single era's show ended except for one, except for the last one, where I exited through a door, an orange door to be specific. And that actually was an Easter egg. Basically, the reason why I chose to exit that way is because I kind of wanted to give a little subliminal hint to the fans that I may be leaving the era's tour era, but I was also entering a new era. So I wanted to show you something. Okay. What do we got? We got a briefcase. Yep. McGreen with TS on it. Yep. What's in it? This is my brand new album. We got TS12, baby. This is my brand new album. It's called The Life of a Showgirl. Love it. It was something that I was working on while I was in Europe on the era's tour. While you were on tour. I was working. I would be on tour. How unearthed did she do this on the tour is still blowing my mind. I just love it. I just love it a lot. I love music. I would be playing shows. I'd do like three shows in a row. I'd have three days off. I'd fly to Sweden, go back to the tour and actually like working on this. I was physically exhausted at this point in the tour, but I was so mentally stimulated and so excited to be creating. And this is... And literally living the life of a showgirl. I was. While she wrote it. That's why I called it that. Nailed it. So do you want to see the back cover? I would love to see all of it. Yes. Back cover is where we find the 12 tracks for my 12... 12 tracks. Bangers. Okay. So this is... So we got all... What are they? So we got track one, The Fate of Ophelia. Okay. Track two. Go ahead. I was going to say, do you know what Fate of Ophelia is? I just... Hamlet? I don't want to get Jason all riled up. We can just go through the track. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Track two, Elizabeth Taylor. Okay. You know who Elizabeth Taylor is? You better. I'm just kind of following. Just kind of following along. Okay. All right. All right. Track three, Opalite. Opalite. You know what Opalite is, Jason? Why? Can we stop asking me... Okay. I'm done. Yes. I'm not asking Jason things. He's like, I hate this. I know a lot about this album. And I'm excited. Track four, Father Figure. Track five, Eldest Daughter. Track six, Ruin the Friendship. Track seven, Actually Romantic. Actually Romantic? Track eight, Wish List with $2 signs as the S's. I just want to point that out. There you go. Flourish. Track nine, Wood. Wood. Nice. Track 10, Cancelled, but it's in all caps with an exclamation point at the end. That's a banger. Track 11, Honey. And can you do drum roll? Last track, track 12, the title track, The Life of a Showgirl featuring Sabrina Carpenter. Sabrina Carpenter! That's awesome. So that's that. Yeah. And so that is a showgirl. We've got this orange vinyl here. Yeah, it is. And sparkly. Entering a new era. Sparkly. It's very nice. So what is the significance of the color orange? Why orange? I've just always liked it, Jason. It really, it really feels like, I don't know. It feels like kind of energetically how my life has felt. And this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant. And one of the things about this record is like, it's a record I made with my mentor, Max Martin and Shellback. And the three of us have made some of my favorite songs that I've ever done before. Nice. Which ones, if you don't mind me asking? Well, they were my main collaborators on the Red album. We did We Are Never Getting Back Together, I Knew You Were Trouble, 22, Shake It Off, Blank Space, Style, Wildest Dreams. Oh, hell yes. You know, ready for it. So that's the energy we're going with. Yes, I understand why it's orange now. Okay. So yeah, we've made songs that I'm so proud of. There's going to be some fucking bangers. Yes, I'm picking it up. Yeah, it's like that. I'm telling you it's 12. It's like that. And so basically, we've never actually made an album before where it's just the three of us. There's no other collaborators. It's just the three of us making a focused album where, I mean, it felt like catching lightning in a bottle, honestly. We hadn't worked together in like seven or eight years. And... This feeds. This feeds. They're just awesome. They're just something. There's something about it. These guys, they're just geniuses in different avenues, in different ways. We kind of... I'm gonna put it down. I just... Travis, hold it. I've just never... Today's the first day I've seen it. Do you know what I mean? I'm just like... So Travis is just gonna cradle it the whole time. Don't drop the baby. I will not drop this baby. So it's like working with them again was absolutely incredible. And actually, when I was on tour in Stockholm, I had Max Martin come out to the show. And I was talking to him and I was like, I just feel like... I feel like we could just knock it out of the park if we went back in. And we did this all in Sweden and it was just us three. Like, I want to... I essentially said to him, I want to be as proud of an album as I am of the era's tour. And for the same reasons. And he was like, do you understand what kind of pressure that is? Yeah, I was about to say, that is okay. I was like, yeah. Why would you... Yeah, we can try. Let's try. So your entire career? Got it. Yeah, we can do that in one album. Let's do it. Well, okay. So it's like, I spent time in the time that we were off doing different projects and he and Shellback were doing different things. And I was making albums that were a little bit more esoteric, like folklore. She's so hot, she says these big words. You know what esoteric means. I know, it's for a specific following. Exactly. Exactly. Wait, what? He knows what that means. What does esoteric mean? He doesn't know what these words mean, but he knows what they mean. Esoteric means for a specific following, like a specific genre of people. He knows what it means. Okay. He's doing... He does like a pretty, I don't know what it means thing, but he knows all the words and he knows what they mean. And he may not have read Hamlet, but I explained it to him. Okay, there we go. Don't tell my middle school English teacher I didn't read Hamlet. So... Because I definitely was supposed to. Spark notes. It's all right, I watched the Lion King. See, he knows what Hamlet is. Wait, Lion King is based off of Hamlet? Yes. Jason, your Reddit searches need to be more focused on relevant things. We need to get... We need your relationship with the internet to be like a little bit pure. Don't... I got the algorithm. I got the algorithm. My relationship with the... I'll send it. My relationship with the internet is bad. It is about as bad as you can get. Yeah. Sorry. No, you're fine. So I was like... I made a few records that were a bit more like specific in their sound or whatever, folklore, evermore. Those were a little bit more like alt-folk kind of leaning and just kind of exploring and trying to challenge myself as a writer. And I feel like both Max and Shellback did that too in their own ways going out into the world. And by the time we came back together, I feel like we had so much more dexterity to what we do. And it's almost like we'd all grown up so much. Like Shellback and I were both in our early 20s when we started working together, the three of us. And so it was very much like we were the ingenues. And Max was the mentor. And this was the time where it felt like all three of us in the room were carrying the same weight as creators. And it was really special. It meant the world to me to have this creative experience where we knew that we had to bring the best ideas we've ever had. And I also know the pressure I'm putting on this record by saying that, but I don't care because I love it that much. And I'm so proud of it. And it just comes from like the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life. And so that effervescence has come through on this record. And like, as you said, bangers. And we were just like, there's no other songs coming. It's not like with Torture Poets Department, I was like, here's a data dump of everything I've thought. There's a lot of songs on that one. In two or three years. Here's 31 songs. This is 12. There's not a 13th. There's not other ones coming. This is the record I've been wanting to make for a very long time. I love it. I love this so much. So where do we start? I don't know where to start. You gave us a lot of information right there. I know. We didn't tell Jason that we were doing this. I just said, can I go on the podcast? Because Brad Pitt did it and I want to do it too. Jason was like, yes, I mean, we can make that happen. The request or the ask from either one of us was never going to come. I don't know why I would never ask you. I just, I don't know. Yeah. Brandon still hates me because I never asked you. But I think this is way better. We waited until I had some stuff to say, I think. There we go. You know, I was waiting until I had like a sparkly briefcase to bring. I needed props. It took a long time to put that into production. Well, it is finished. And do you want to tell everybody when it's coming out? It comes out October 3rd. October 3rd. This album comes out October 3rd. It's easy to remember. It's 10-3. 10-3. Still annoying. It is also your birthday week. We got Wyatt October 2nd. We got you October 5th. And then we got mom October 9th. So this is a good, this is a good month. Yeah, I picked a good month. It's going to be a good week. You know, all these Libras out here. 10-3, 13. The Opal birthstones. I'm picking up this numerology. There we go. There we go. See? Never not annoying. Always going to try to force a 13 into the situation. And this one was right there. It was just right there. For the photos, there's a lot more, there are a lot more photos in this. And there's, there's a poem in this. And basically I love the photography so much that I don't want to show it right now because I want to keep some mystery going. Because that's, you know, it's fun to have things still discovered. But the photos are done by Merton Marcus, who are two of my favorite photographers. The last time I, the only time I worked with them for an album cover shoot was with Reputation with that album. And I loved what they did with those photos. So I called them up for this one. And I'm so happy with the way that the photos came out for this one. And it just basically was like, I was so proud of the music and so excited about this project from a creative standpoint that I was just like, all hands on deck. We're going all out. This is a full send. I care about this record more than I can even overstate. It's so much fun. I mean, I understand what she's saying. Obviously I've been fortunate enough to hear every single song on here. So I know they're all 12 bangers. It's a lot more upbeat and it's a lot more like fun pop, like excitement. And I think that's a completely like, I think it's a complete 180 from a lot of the songs on Torture Poets for sure. Oh yeah. Life is more upbeat. Well, that's what I was about to say. Do you find that your albums mimic everything that's happening in your personal life? Yeah, definitely. Your genres that you've done are like so wide spanning between like country, pop. And then like it can get, I don't even know, Torture Poets. It was like so cathartic. It felt like for you probably to write those songs and to release all that. Definitely. And it was like, I have different goals with different albums. And Torture Poets department, my goals were strictly lyrical. And I love that. It felt like every song was a poem. Oh yeah. And I love that album so much from that perspective. That was strictly what I was trying to accomplish there was just really a full catharsis. And I loved to embrace the mess of writing from that perspective, of the rawness of that. This, I have a totally different set of goals. I always try to do something completely different. That's what I'm feeling at the moment. And I was feeling a complete pivot at this point in time. And I wanted the album to feel the way my life felt. And this completely matches the way that my life has felt. And I also wanted it to be just every single song is on this album for hundreds of reasons. And you couldn't take one out and it be the same album. You couldn't add one and it be, it's just right. And that focus and that kind of discipline with creating an album and keeping the bar really high is something I've been wanting to do for a very long time. I tend to love to write lots and lots of music. So it's a temptation to release lots of music. Sure. I wanted to do an album that was so focused on quality and on the theme and everything fitting together like a perfect puzzle that these 12 songs from my 12th album, I feel like we achieved that and I'm really happy about that. So you mentioned a couple of things there. First, what is the theme of the album if you would describe it as one theme, if that's possible? I would say it's everything that was going on behind the curtain. Okay. And then what are the goals? You said something like, what would be your main goals with this album? My main goals were melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it. And lyrics that are just as vivid, but crisp and focused and completely intentional. Check. So it's like, I feel like we actually came together in a really beautiful way. The three of us, Shellback, Max and I, where we had a conversation about how Max was like, I loved folklore. I loved the storytelling on folklore. I don't want that to change. Just because we're making these infectious anthems, I don't want you to leave that behind. And I was like, I don't think I couldn't if I tried. I got some stuff to say. I'm married to that kind of writing. And so it was really amazing that we were able to, without doing too much overthinking, we were able to get in there. And it was just ideas flying. And all of these ideas were like, we've been waiting years to come back together and make this project. You are going to move. Do I have to wait till October 3rd? Yes, you do, Jason. Yeah, I mean, this is unfair. We don't trust you at all. Yeah. I mean, honestly, smart. I completely get it. Completely get it. The artwork, how do you settle on a front piece of artwork for an album? This represents the end of my night. So when I'm on tour, I have the same day every single day. It's another reason why we have a very similar life. His game days are the same days every day. His practice days are the same every day. His meetings are scheduled. My show days are the same every single day. I just happen to be in a different city. And my day ends with me in a bathtub, not usually in a bedazzled dress. Sure. It's on the front of it. I wanted to sort of like glamorize all the different aspects of how that tour felt. And that's how that felt to like be at the end of the night when all this has gone down. You won't be able to get to bed till four in the morning after this. But you had to jump through 50 million hoops in this obstacle course that is your show. And you did it. You got two more in a row. But you did it tonight. That's all that matters. And the reason I wanted to have it sort of like an offstage moment as the main album cover is because this album isn't really about what happened to me on stage. It's about what I was going through offstage. Sure. It's like, you know, I didn't want to have like the lights are bright. I'm on the stage as the main album cover. It's just this to me tells more of what the actual contents lyrically of the album are. Got it. Which is the life. The life of the showgirl. Not what you're seeing. It's the life behind everything. Behind it all. It's the life beyond the show. Okay. Which is fascinating. Travis, I'm very jealous. Very jealous that you've heard these songs. As you should be, Jason. Yes. As you should be. I think it's very fitting that it's orange. I mean, it looks like a giant sun. Pull that thing out again. Like it feels like it's going to be full of energy. Like the record itself. You have no idea, Jason. All right. Look at that thing. That thing is awesome. That is so cool. Very cool. Thank you. All right. Well, congratulations, Taylor. October 3rd, baby. Congratulations. Thank you so much. Everyone, you heard it here first. You have heard it here first. October 3rd is the release date of the TS-12, the life of a showgirl. 12 bangers. Congratulations, Taylor. I know you've been working on this for a long time. You're going to be moving the entire album. Thank you so much. You can preorder it now. You can preorder it now? There we go. Yeah, on my website. Okay. I'll be right back, guys. You heard it here first, folks. The life of a showgirl is available now. You can preorder it. And the official release date is 10-3. That's October 3rd. Yes, sir. All righty. We are going to move to We Gotta Ask. You don't have to answer. Okay. I know you're familiar with this segment, but for anybody listening, this is a segment we often get to where our guests, we're going to ask a bunch of rapid fire questions. They are not obligated to answer. They matter fact, they are free to tell us to fuck off if they choose. Okay, cool. If you choose. All right. How do you feel about Jason telling his kids the cats are poisonous? It was actually really a great challenge because as soon as I got the kids around the cats, it was my goal to prove to them that they weren't poisonous. And there's no better way to prove that than to just hand them Benjamin, my right-hand guy, who lets humans hold him like he's a baby. And I mean, like my favorite thing ever is just like when Benny will come up to me and just go, I find Benjamin. I find him. And she's just like over there, just like laying with him and petting him and holding him. And they're the cats are so good with kids. They're like drag. They're just like, there's like, Meredith is here. I'm like, yeah. And you know what? She didn't bite you at all, did she? No, she didn't. And if she did bite you, she wouldn't be poisonous. They're like, that's not what our dad said. Well, I heard you're getting a cat. Very well-placed source. Well, neither confirm nor deny. We'll see if that does get to that. You're getting like a cat that chases mice. What I have or not that. Yes. I think there is a chance. And there's a happy medium. There's a chance I've been talked into a barn cat that does not go inside that will go survive, survive off of rodents in the field. It's those are going to be sneaking that cat. There's no way that cat will say this is why I lie to my kids though is to, I want them to be able to be critical thinkers. They need to realize it's absurd to think this and you handing them Benjamin and then real and then walking them through critical thinking ability. Yeah. Now all of a sudden they won't believe something that every moron tells them on the internet. Yeah. It was really like, I know it wasn't helpful for you, but it was helpful for me. My allergies are going to be in severe. I don't even know if the allergies are a thing, Jason. I think you just, I mean, I've had an allergy test, Taylor. I've had an allergy test. Oh yeah. They know you everything. Allegedly. I'd like to see a copy of it. Fair enough. It's just, I think that you just like, maybe don't like. I don't, I mean, I think some cats I get down with, I always like flash growing up. The cat that we had. What did you think of? What did you think of my three cats? My three perfect. The only one that would go near me was Benjamin. Yeah. Cause the other two consents that you had resting cat. He turned that might be it. All right. If you had to choose to bake one thing to show off your baking skills, what would you choose? Oh, right now it would be my cinnamon swirl sourdough. Cinnamon swirl sourdough. I thought you were going to go pop tarts. Pop tarts, pop tarts. It depends on who I'm baking for the pop tarts. God, I just love making pop music and pop tarts. I love it. I didn't even put those two together, but that makes a ton of sense. Been really experimenting with the flavors there because we got now wild blueberry, raspberry, strawberry, the original, and Kylie got me baking the cinnamon sugar. You're doing that now. Yes. Well, if I may, we need an orange pop tart now. We need what's a. I mean. I'll do it if you really want me to like with like a marmalade, like an orange marmalade in the middle and then orange extract. An orange Paddington Bear. A little Paddington Bear. Okay. No, I can get with this. I just didn't see the vision until now and now I think it's kind of genius. You've ruined pop tarts outside of yours just so you know. Thank you. Thank you so much. So now I got to try the cinnamon swirl sourdough though. If you're putting that above pop tarts. Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to send some over. It's a banger. Perfect. There's a rumor that you played the bear in happy Gilmore too. In the scene where Travis says he put on him. Oh my God. Or deny this rumor. I can deny like this is this is one of those ones where like we'll send it to each other and be like, Hey, did you hear I was the bear in there? He's like, yeah, you hear we bought a house in Lake Como. Yeah, right. It's we're just sort of like at this point, we're just like, of course they think I'm inside of a bear costume. I'm honored to be thought of in that context because I loved that movie so much. I watched it multiple times. Loved it so much. Whoever did the bear acting was solid. Bear is it. Exquisite performance. Bad Bunny and the bear killed that scene. Yeah, Bad Bunny. He absolutely delighted me in that movie. I was so good. Would you like a breast? It's amazing. His comedic timing is so good. There's this one part where they look over where they're like, who did that? His name is Oscar. His character's name is Oscar. His brother gets hit by the golf ball and they look over and they're like, who did that? Who did that? And they do. There's a face that Bad Bunny makes and they do the kind of like the quick pan in the zoom. And it was just, I was like, who thought of that? How did they know he could be that? I watched it five times. Benito kills it. He absolutely kills it. He's so funny. He's so good. He's also like, no, I felt so much for this character. I'm so excited to go to his restaurant. I thought this was a real man. I believed this. Whose idea was arriving to the errors tour stage via a cleaning cart? Mine. That's a weird idea that I, that's my type of weird idea. Where did that come from? Well, when you're putting on a first show of a tour like that, you're not just performing for the entire stadium. You're performing for the entire internet. And so I wanted to curate and really romanticize the images that they were seeing first. So I didn't want them to see my first outfit and my first look, which would have given away what the first era was before, you know, when I'm walking up the ramp behind the stage, there's all these fans that are seated behind the stage at certain angles that where they would have been able to film it. I didn't want that to be the first thing people saw from the errors tour. I wanted it to be the huge lover motif. And they're surprised and delighted by the fact that lovers, the first era we're doing and they have, that's the first time they've seen that Versace body suit all lit up like, once the lights hit that thing, it's just like, oh, I love that outfit so much. And so it was really about preserving kind of like the sanctity of a surprise moment. Right? So I kind of thought I might only do it for a night one. And then I just got attached to it. I was like, I just, I find this fun. It's the perfect intro. It really is. There's a like weird little side of me that likes sneaking around. And I think the fans found it funny too. They're like, what a weirdo. We've come to see a weirdo in concert. Why is she doing that? I don't know. Why did I make it look like a mop cart? I don't know, man. There's just like, so like, if you can't have fun with the hijinks of this thing, there's enough stress that goes into this. If you can't get joy from silly little things like the mop cart, man. Yeah. You need to live a little. You're doing it wrong. Live a little. Get into a fake mop cart. Everyone knows you're in there, but you're in there like, I'm sneaking around. Nobody knows a minute. Everyone knows you're in there. Well, it's like, it's one of those things like I work so hard to try to surprise fans. And they're like, I don't want to be surprised. Sometimes they really don't think they want to be surprised. I want to figure stuff out. No, they do. But then I know, I know that when I can really get them and surprise them, that it was so worth it. Because that's what entertainment is really. It's just giving people something to escape, to sink their teeth into, to like, we're world building. You know, that's what the whole tour was. Hopefully people never thought that we'd go on this podcast and announce an album. Like, I was hoping that that's something that the fans would be like, that's from left field. Like, if we accomplish that, then that's- She went out with those two idiots to release this? Man, things are really getting dark for Taylor. All right. We ask all of our guests this. What is your welcome to the NFL moment? Oh, oh, I'd say it was the first time I stepped on the field, which would have been when you won the AFC championship. Baltimore. The first season that I was with you and it was in Baltimore. And we're in the suite and he's just won the AFC championship. We're freaking out. Everybody's screaming and his mom goes, all right, let's go down to the field. And I was like, what are we doing? What do you mean? What are you talking about? We're going where? And she's like, we're going down to the field. And I was like, did he say that that's okay? Like, because we hadn't talked about this. There was no like, hey, if I win this game- I didn't want to jinx it. Yeah, he doesn't jinx anything, which I respect actually. Like, I'm all about that. But we hadn't had a conversation about it. So I'm like, is he going to be like, what are you doing down here, dude? No, it was- You don't have to be presumptuous. Mama knows best. She knew I wanted you to know. And so she was like, trust me, he wants you there. And I was like, okay, well, she would know. And so I'm walking out onto this field and it's just like, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. This is, it's so, there's so many lights. We're going to the Super Bowl. I've never seen this many cameras. I've never seen, like, I've never seen this much media in my life. And I've seen a lot of media. And then the media sees me and they're like, and then they just start running at me and I'm looking at you and you're, and then you're screaming into the mic because when there's a mic and there's Travis, like he physically needs to scream into it. Of course. All right. Okay. That's like, I just, so basically I'm experiencing this whole heightened scenario that I had no idea five minutes before I was going to be experiencing. And it was, it's one of my most cherished memories because I was so proud of you. And I was so proud that you came down there to enjoy that moment. It was so magical. It was so fun. It's like crazy. It's crazy to get to see someone you love work that hard and then have that kind of like euphoric payoff where you're like, for sure you did it. Like you did it underlined a hundred times. You did like, you did it. Human exclamation point. What do you mean? That's crazy. Like, yeah, I had such a great rookie year. It was crazy. It was a great year. What is your welcome to like, I don't know if it's like singer, like, like being a pop star, being a performer. What is your welcome to the industry moment in that regard? Oh my God. Man, I never really. I actually never really allowed myself to feel like though you've arrived thing. Sure. I've just now started to be able to really be in a moment when I'm in the moment. That's why I'm so glad that the errors tour happened when I'm an adult because I was able to completely and totally soak in these moments. Well, I'm planning obviously what I'm doing next in the show, but like when I'm at the end of that show and I'm standing there taking it in, that's me a hundred percent present. But, you know, starting to do this when I was putting out my first album, I was like 16, I was always onto the next plan and that I get joy in planning. So it's not like I wasn't happy with that, but I never allowed myself to say you've arrived, you've made it. I was always like, how are you getting, how are you going to get to make the next project? And it was all about, it was all about the, the higher I climbed to more creative control I had and the more fun I had making stuff. Right. Yeah. So it was not the, like the altitude I was reaching, there was more pressure every step of the way, but I was getting more creative control and freedom every time. And that is why it felt so much more special to keep working harder, to get to new levels. It's not like, oh, like I can afford to buy this or whatever, like it, not to discount that. But for me, every time I got higher up on a new rung of the ladder, I could make stuff in a more focused and free and autonomous way. What else would you want as an artist? I never really let myself be like, I've made it, but the arrows tour, I was like, oh, this is different. Like this is not, this is nothing like what I've ever experienced before. It was so much better than anything. Literally while she's doing that, she's still creating the next thing. Yeah. I love it. I love show Sweden, live show Sweden, Yeah. That's what's nice. No, I adore what I do. I absolutely love it. And I love then taking the songs and writing a treatment for a music video and directing the music video, like all of the things that I get to do now. I'm so grateful for the ability to create. Like that's still what drives all of it. Well, us Swifties appreciate your dedication. We are very grateful for this as well. Thanks guys. Alrighty. Do you have any questions for us? We're kind of out of the questions for this section. Is there anything you wanted to ask Travis or I? I mean, you have a, you put Travis on the spot right now. Yeah, I know. Oh God. Well, I, I don't know. I was wondering how that wax is growing in. Like, because I haven't talked to him a couple of weeks about it and I just feel like it's really important for you to like make sure that those hairs don't grow. Getting a little itchy, bud. No, it's fine. When you go like when you go from fur to no fur at all. We got some thick hair. It's like important to figure out. Like I mean, just don't tell us how are we doing? We're doing good. We're doing managing it. Well, we're not managing it. That's how we're managing it is we're not managing it. Okay. It's fortunate for me. My hair grows fast. Yep. It's coarse. It's got a texture that was difficult for about a couple of weeks. Yeah. Very itchy. Yep. That's what I thought. We've passed that phase now. And are we going to do it again? Do you think? I don't think so. And I listen, shout out to the people in downtown Philadelphia. They did a great job. European wax. I'm not. I don't think it's going to be a recurring bit. Yeah, it was the best it could have been. I also don't think I'm going to find myself in a speedo again. Jason walked into a door that said European wax and was treated with the utmost respect in class. He had to try it. That's life. It feels important that you did it. Because now you know. I know what it would have been good for. I always say that after I make unfortunate judgment calls. Well, now I know. Now I know. Had to try it. The one thing I didn't try was- Wasn't great. Wasn't great. Wouldn't do it again. On that note- Now you know. Thanks for having me. Tay, thank you so much for hopping on. Oh my gosh. All right. Thank you so much for hopping on. You are the best. This has been a blast. I think Kylie enjoyed being the number one most viewed episode for her time that she had. Don't you do that to Kylie? Don't do that. It's not about Kylie. If you guys throw Kylie under the bus, you're going to pay for it. That was just uncalled for. Why didn't Elliot already do it? You find out. That's right.

It's a confused. The cat ate something. It doesn't know what it is. This is this that gets gets me every time. That gets me every time, man. I will laugh at that. I will like fall off the couch laughing at that if he'll do it at, you know.",
