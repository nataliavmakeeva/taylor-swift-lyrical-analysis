      "[13:30.560 --> 13:37.560]  Insubordinate. Yeah, it's I think for me, you know, that was the closest I ever thought I would get to owning my music.\n",
      "[13:37.560 --> 13:44.560]  And so rerecording my music, it was so exciting to get to have that opportunity.\n",
      "[13:44.560 --> 13:49.560]  But there was still like I thought about not owning my music every day.\n",
      "[13:49.560 --> 13:51.560]  It was something that I never was.\n",
      "[13:51.560 --> 13:54.560]  It's like an intrusive thought that I had every day.\n",
      "[13:54.560 --> 13:59.560]  And so we do the Ares tour after the Ares tour.\n",
      "[13:59.560 --> 14:05.560]  I had a meeting with my team and we we decided this might be a good time to approach the current owners of it.\n",
      "[14:05.560 --> 14:10.560]  The owners of it was a private equity firm called Shamrock Capital.\n",
      "[14:10.560 --> 14:14.560]  I knew them to be above board people.\n",
      "[14:14.560 --> 14:19.560]  You know, they had been very friendly to us.\n",
      "[14:19.560 --> 14:23.560]  What I was looking to do, though, was I wanted to buy my music outright.\n",
      "[14:23.560 --> 14:26.560]  I don't want to be in a partnership. I don't want to own 30 percent of it.\n",
      "[14:26.560 --> 14:28.560]  I want it. I want to own all of it.\n",
      "[14:28.560 --> 14:29.560]  And you deserve that.\n",
      "[14:29.560 --> 14:34.560]  But it was a long shot to think that they would do that, that they would sell that that asset to me.\n",
      "[14:34.560 --> 14:35.560]  It's a big asset.\n",
      "[14:35.560 --> 14:40.560]  It's a huge decision for them to make to sell that to anyone, including me.\n",
      "[14:40.560 --> 14:48.560]  I decided that rather than this be like a business conversation, I I'm in the business of human emotion.\n",
      "[14:48.560 --> 14:58.560]  I would so much rather lead heart first in something like this, because for me, this is not, oh, I want to I want to own this asset because if it's returns,\n",
      "[14:58.560 --> 15:09.560]  because if it's, you know, because of the dividends that I will receive over the years, this was I want it because this is my handwritten diary entries from my whole life.\n",
      "[15:09.560 --> 15:12.560]  These are the songs I wrote about every phase of my life.\n",
      "[15:12.560 --> 15:16.560]  This is my photography, my music videos, my most of which I funded.\n",
      "[15:16.560 --> 15:21.560]  You know, my artwork, everything that I've ever done is in this catalog.\n",
      "[15:21.560 --> 15:33.560]  And so rather than send lawyers or management like in a big crew, I sent my mom and my brother, who I work with, to L.A.\n",
      "[15:33.560 --> 15:38.560]  And they sorry, they sat down and they like this happens.\n",
      "[15:38.560 --> 15:49.560]  I don't ever really talk about it because it's they sat with with Shamrock Capital and they told them what this meant for me.\n",
      "[15:49.560 --> 16:00.560]  Like this is they told them the whole story of all the times we've tried to buy it, all the times it's fallen through, all the times we had gotten plans together and figured out something we thought was going to work.\n",
      "[16:00.560 --> 16:04.560]  And it didn't at the last minute. And so like my mom calls me afterwards.\n",
      "[16:04.560 --> 16:07.560]  She's like, look, you know, they were wonderful. They they heard us out.\n",
      "[16:07.560 --> 16:10.560]  We have no idea which way they're going to go with this.\n",
      "[16:10.560 --> 16:17.560]  And so I was like, I get it. I get it. I haven't gotten my hopes up about this in a decade.\n",
      "[16:17.560 --> 16:21.560]  And so it was a couple months after the Super Bowl.\n",

      "[17:56.560 --> 18:01.560]  I think about this every day now, but instead of it being like an intrusive thought that hurts me,\n",

      "[18:04.560 --> 18:07.560]  How lucky am I? How grateful am I?\n",
      "[18:07.560 --> 18:10.560]  I'm so grateful to like the artists that helped me with my re-records,\n",
      "[18:10.560 --> 18:15.560]  because when I did my re-records, I started doing those in 2021.\n",
      "[18:15.560 --> 18:20.560]  And a lot like most of the industry trades were like, this is a bad idea.\n",

      "[18:32.560 --> 18:37.560]  And it was like I still was able to like reach out to friends of mine like like like Phoebe Bridgers,\n",
      "[18:37.560 --> 18:42.560]  Keith Urban, Marin Morris, Chris Stapleton, you know, Haley Williams from Paramore,\n",
      "[18:42.560 --> 18:50.560]  Fall Out Boy, like all these absolutely incredible artists that like shape who I am as an artist.\n",
      "[18:50.560 --> 18:54.560]  And they like agreed to be a part of the re-records.\n",
      "[18:54.560 --> 19:02.560]  And I like, you know, I one of the only people I told before this happened was like I called Phoebe Bridgers and I was just like,\n",
      "[19:02.560 --> 19:10.560]  And she's like, I think you just did you just say what I think you said?\n",
      "[19:10.560 --> 19:14.560]  And so this has just been like it was just I'm so grateful for it.\n",
      "[19:14.560 --> 19:17.560]  It's it's just unbelievable.\n",
      "[19:17.560 --> 19:19.560]  And I was so happy you were there when that happened.\n",
      "[19:19.560 --> 19:21.560]  I mean, I was because I could not stand.\n",
      "[19:21.560 --> 19:22.560]  Yeah, I mean, I started crying too.\n",
      "[19:22.560 --> 19:23.560]  You know, I'm a weeping.\n",
      "[19:23.560 --> 19:28.560]  I was just so happy for you because I've seen I've seen how you make music.\n",
      "[19:28.560 --> 19:36.560]  I've seen how you make these videos, seen the effort and the focus and the strategy behind what just one album in Torture Poets Department\n",
      "[19:36.560 --> 19:42.560]  and and and then Fortnight and I was blown away that you had been doing this your entire life.\n",
      "[19:42.560 --> 19:50.560]  And for, you know, your first six albums, you weren't given the rights to all of that.\n",
      "[19:50.560 --> 19:52.560]  And I know what that that looked like.\n",
      "[19:52.560 --> 19:57.560]  And I know how much it burns you that that you didn't have that and you didn't have your creation.\n",
      "[19:57.560 --> 20:05.560]  And I just I think doing it the right way, creating the fan base that you did the right way and and and leading your audience.\n",
      "[20:05.560 --> 20:15.560]  And and leading your life in a direction that you you were eventually going to get it back somehow some way because of you always doing things with the right intentions.\n",
      "[20:15.560 --> 20:19.560]  So so how I guess how does music owners.\n",
      "[20:19.560 --> 20:20.560]  This is so crazy to me.\n",
      "[20:20.560 --> 20:24.560]  So you wrote these songs, you sang these songs, you put everything into them.\n",
      "[20:24.560 --> 20:28.560]  And don't get me wrong, there's publishing companies, people that support artists out there.\n",
      "[20:28.560 --> 20:31.560]  But yeah, how how does ownership of music even work?\n",
      "[20:31.560 --> 20:34.560]  Like when you recorded these songs when you were 16, right?\n",
      "[20:34.560 --> 20:38.560]  Is that like you've done it down to us?\n",
      "[20:38.560 --> 20:39.560]  Ninety percent.\n",
      "[20:39.560 --> 20:41.560]  The singer gets a certain portion.\n",
      "[20:41.560 --> 20:48.560]  The the artist gets us or the songwriter gets a certain portion and then the publishing company gets a certain portion.\n",
      "[20:48.560 --> 20:51.560]  OK, so this is that's a great question.\n",
      "[20:51.560 --> 20:54.560]  And there's two main categories that we're talking about here.\n",
      "[20:54.560 --> 20:59.560]  So Master Recordings is the actual recording.\n",
      "[20:59.560 --> 21:06.560]  Yes, it's the actual vocal band production, mixing, mastering that actual thing.\n",
      "[21:06.560 --> 21:07.560]  Yes, mine.\n",
      "[21:07.560 --> 21:17.560]  Mine also included my album artwork, my music videos, everything that went along with any era of music that I had done for my first six albums.\n",
      "[21:17.560 --> 21:18.560]  Every year.\n",
      "[21:18.560 --> 21:24.560]  So then there's also then there's another category, which is publishing.\n",
      "[21:24.560 --> 21:38.560]  I own my publishing, which is why, you know, I have control over, you know, if my song is used in a film, I and I and I wanted them to use Taylor's version instead of the original version.\n",
      "[21:38.560 --> 21:40.560]  I, the songwriter, can decide that.\n",
      "[21:40.560 --> 21:41.560]  Got it. OK.\n",
      "[21:41.560 --> 21:48.560]  You know, and so it's like I basically I've always been very lucky because my publishing was protected.\n",
      "[21:48.560 --> 21:54.560]  A lot of artists have have their publishing sold away from them or they sell their publishing.\n",
      "[21:54.560 --> 21:58.560]  And I, you know, and a lot of artists, it may not be important to them.\n",
      "[21:58.560 --> 21:59.560]  It was always important for me.\n",
      "[21:59.560 --> 22:12.560]  The publishing aspect of it has always been something I've had firmly in place, which is great because my songwriting is the core of why I do this, why I love it so much and what I think has made anything happen in my career at all.\n",
      "[22:12.560 --> 22:14.560]  Greatest songwriter of all time.\n",
      "[22:14.560 --> 22:15.560]  That's very nice of you to say that.\n",
      "[22:15.560 --> 22:19.560]  It's like says her boyfriend says a lot of people.\n",
      "[22:19.560 --> 22:24.560]  Basically, then you have the master recordings side of things.\n",
      "[22:24.560 --> 22:33.560]  Now, this is a discussion that was not really brought up amongst the artists communities, especially not with fans.\n",
      "[22:33.560 --> 22:41.560]  This was all kind of industry centric and kind of boring contract stuff that like fans were not speaking about.\n",
      "[22:41.560 --> 22:53.560]  And so one thing that I think is really great that has come about because of this is that I have so many new artists come up to me now and say, hey, I didn't even know this was a thing.\n",
      "[22:53.560 --> 23:04.560]  And when I went to go and negotiate for my record deal, I negotiated to have my masters revert back to me after a certain amount of years or that I own them outright.\n"

      "[23:15.560 --> 23:25.560]  What I wanted, though, is that if I were to put the information out about what I went through, at least it gets artists talking about this to decide whether this is a priority for them.\n",

      "[23:37.560 --> 23:49.560]  To put it in perspective, if I never would have been able to buy back my music, one day someone else would be leaving all of my music from my first six albums to their kids in their will.\n",
      "[23:49.560 --> 23:51.560]  Right. Yeah.\n",
      "[23:51.560 --> 23:54.560]  And you think about it like that. It's like I thought of it.\n",
      "[23:54.560 --> 23:57.560]  I made it. I recorded it. I paid for most of those music videos.\n",
      "[23:57.560 --> 24:01.560]  You know, I wanted an opportunity to buy that back.\n",
      "[24:01.560 --> 24:05.560]  And that was important to me. You feel like they're yours. They should be yours. Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "[24:05.560 --> 24:17.560]  Do you think it was easier for you to do one because you're I mean, just you talking about this, you're so aware of the business side of this and the legal realm of like you're more aware than I think probably most artists are.\n",
      "[24:17.560 --> 24:23.560]  But being in the world, it's crazy. Being a songwriter, the smartest woman in the world.\n",
      "[24:24.560 --> 24:34.560]  You being the songwriter, being the singer, owning no publishing rights, being able to rerecord songs that gave you leverage and able to make this move.\n",
      "[24:34.560 --> 24:38.560]  Right. Yes. Yeah. Yes. So that was it.\n",
      "[24:38.560 --> 24:47.560]  And also, you know, in my contract, they didn't put a clause in that said I couldn't rerecord because nobody was doing it and nobody thought that was a good idea.\n",
      "[24:47.560 --> 24:51.560]  Right. So and also like who would be that stubborn?\n",

      "[24:57.560 --> 24:59.560]  They would record every single thing.\n",

      "[25:00.560 --> 25:01.560]  Over and over again.\n",
      "[25:01.560 --> 25:02.560]  What was your favorite one?\n",
      "[25:02.560 --> 25:09.560]  Not just that. Hold on, not just that. Who has a fan base that's going to listen to the same album twice in a row?\n",

      "[25:32.560 --> 25:37.560]  And it was it was amazing because, you know, they're the reason why the rerecords worked out.\n",
      "[25:37.560 --> 25:44.560]  They're the reason I was able to purchase my music back because they came to the Aeros tour.\n",

      "[26:09.560 --> 26:22.560]  And I'm I'm so impressed just by their ability and their dexterity as musicians to be able to do that so convincingly because they're they're they're actually some there's the the Taylor's versions on.\n",
      "[26:22.560 --> 26:24.560]  I kind of refer a lot of that stuff.\n",
      "[26:24.560 --> 26:27.560]  I think it sounds incredible, but I'm happy to have all of it.\n",
      "[26:27.560 --> 26:30.560]  So that leads me to the next question today.\n",
      "[26:30.560 --> 26:36.560]  Now that you own all of it, you have the rerecordings, you have the original recordings.\n",
      "[26:36.560 --> 26:37.560]  What should we listen to?\n",
      "[26:37.560 --> 26:38.560]  Like, what do I do?\n",
      "[26:38.560 --> 26:39.560]  I roll.\n",
      "[26:39.560 --> 26:40.560]  It doesn't matter.\n",
      "[26:40.560 --> 26:42.560]  You're just like whatever you guys want.\n",
      "[26:42.560 --> 26:44.560]  It's really whatever you guys want.\n",
      "[26:44.560 --> 26:45.560]  I love both of them.\n",
      "[26:45.560 --> 26:50.560]  I would not have put out the rerecords if I didn't think that they held up or were better.\n",
      "[26:50.560 --> 26:54.560]  I think a lot of the vocals I did on the rerecords are better than the originals.\n",
      "[26:54.560 --> 26:55.560]  Okay.\n",
      "[26:55.560 --> 27:02.560]  But it's like if you found a nostalgia in the originals and that was what you were listening to when you were 12 years old bopping around in your bedroom.\n",
      "[27:02.560 --> 27:03.560]  Go crazy.\n",
      "[27:03.560 --> 27:05.560]  Yeah, we got them all.\n",
      "[27:05.560 --> 27:06.560]  I'm going to start doing comparisons.\n",
      "[27:06.560 --> 27:07.560]  That's what I got to do.\n",
      "[27:07.560 --> 27:08.560]  I just got to start doing comparisons.\n",
      "[27:08.560 --> 27:10.560]  Yeah, you're going to listen to every beat.\n",
      "[27:10.560 --> 27:12.560]  You're certainly not mandatory, Jason.\n",
      "[27:12.560 --> 27:13.560]  I mean, it sounds like a good time.\n",
      "[27:13.560 --> 27:14.560]  I'll say this.\n",
      "[27:14.560 --> 27:17.560]  There's a few good playlists out there that have a mixture of them all.\n",
      "[27:17.560 --> 27:18.560]  You've been streaming?\n",
      "[27:18.560 --> 27:19.560]  Yes.\n",
      "[27:19.560 --> 27:21.560]  I've been streaming for about two years now.\n",

      "[27:23.560 --> 27:24.560]  Thank you so much.\n",
      "[27:24.560 --> 27:29.560]  That's why we got that spike in the 35-year-old male demographic.\n",
      "[27:29.560 --> 27:31.560]  Yes, that 1.7 billion.\n",
      "[27:31.560 --> 27:33.560]  That was at least 1 billion.\n",
      "[27:33.560 --> 27:38.560]  We have one IP address from one iPhone that continually is listening to this.\n",
      "[27:38.560 --> 27:41.560]  Did you have a favorite album that you rerecorded?\n",
      "[27:41.560 --> 27:46.560]  Are there different eras that you liked recording more?\n",
      "[27:46.560 --> 27:50.560]  I really liked them all, but I think Red was very special.\n",
      "[27:50.560 --> 27:53.560]  There were songs that I called From the Vault songs,\n",
      "[27:53.560 --> 27:59.560]  and there was one which I think is maybe my favorite song I've ever written\n",
      "[27:59.560 --> 28:01.560]  called All Too Well, the 10-minute version,\n",
      "[28:01.560 --> 28:03.560]  where I unearthed...\n",
      "[28:03.560 --> 28:06.560]  There were originally so many more verses in that song\n",
      "[28:06.560 --> 28:11.560]  than ended up being on the album that I had put out when I originally put out Red.\n",
      "[28:12.560 --> 28:20.560]  I made the glorious, fortuitous mistake of saying that to my fans in an interview.\n",
      "[28:20.560 --> 28:22.560]  You know what those words mean.\n",
      "[28:22.560 --> 28:23.560]  I love it.\n",
      "[28:23.560 --> 28:24.560]  You're so handsome.\n",
      "[28:24.560 --> 28:31.560]  So basically, I said that in an interview to my fans,\n",
      "[28:31.560 --> 28:33.560]  and they just hung on to it.\n",
      "[28:33.560 --> 28:35.560]  They were like, where's the 10-minute version?\n",
      "[28:35.560 --> 28:37.560]  Give us the 10-minute version.\n",
      "[28:37.560 --> 28:38.560]  Yeah.\n",
      "[28:38.560 --> 28:43.560]  And when it came time to doing Taylor's version and rerecording the album,\n",
      "[28:43.560 --> 28:49.560]  I went back in, found the verses, restructured the song\n",
      "[28:49.560 --> 28:52.560]  to the way that it pretty much was when I had originally written it,\n",
      "[28:52.560 --> 28:54.560]  put them back in.\n",
      "[28:55.560 --> 28:59.560]  And that song is one of my favorite things I've ever done.\n",
      "[28:59.560 --> 29:01.560]  And it was when we were on the Eras Tour,\n",

      "[31:30.560 --> 31:33.560]  It was like the most formative time of my life.\n",
      "[31:33.560 --> 31:39.560]  I learned so much about about how far I can push myself.\n",
      "[31:39.560 --> 31:48.560]  And if I set a goal, you know, making that a three and a half hour show in the beginning of the tour, it's like you can't like be sick one day and then decide tonight.\n",
      "[31:48.560 --> 31:50.560]  It's going to be two and a half hours.\n",
      "[31:50.560 --> 31:56.560]  And it's really just like prioritizing the fans experience before before anything else.\n",
      "[31:56.560 --> 31:58.560]  And my fellow broken heart.\n",
      "[31:58.560 --> 32:00.560]  Yeah, don't get me started.\n",
      "[32:00.560 --> 32:07.560]  Don't you get me started or like stomach flu or like just like aching feet or blisters or whatever.\n",
      "[32:07.560 --> 32:14.560]  Like it's it just which she had all of this going through all at the same time.\n",
      "[32:14.560 --> 32:16.560]  But when you tour fourth show.\n",
      "[32:16.560 --> 32:27.560]  Yeah. And it's just it was kind of the coolest thing in the world because when we were putting together this tour, I had some really lofty goals I wanted to reach conceptually because I wanted to show.\n",
      "[32:27.560 --> 32:43.560]  I wanted to show fans and especially younger fans visuals and sort of performance art references that were really important to me as a kid and what inspired me to want to do this.\n",
      "[32:43.560 --> 32:55.560]  Right. So like I wanted to put elements of musical theater Broadway ballet, you know, scenery that you would see in an opera kind of things like this.\n",
      "[32:55.560 --> 32:57.560]  I watched the whole tour.\n",
      "[32:57.560 --> 32:59.560]  I don't I just thought it was amazing.\n",
      "[32:59.560 --> 33:00.560]  But that's that's exactly it.\n",
      "[33:00.560 --> 33:10.560]  I wanted it to be references that I thought were really high concept and really high value for fans and for them to see things they hadn't necessarily seen before all in one concert.\n",
      "[33:10.560 --> 33:16.560]  But I wanted to do it at at the highest intensity rapid fire.\n",
      "[33:16.560 --> 33:20.560]  You're seeing something new every 15 to 30 seconds.\n",
      "[33:20.560 --> 33:23.560]  And so it feels like you're scrolling in an algorithm.\n",
      "[33:23.560 --> 33:34.560]  Right. And when I heard reports of people saying that they got actual amnesia after the concerts, I was like, Oh, I think we did it.\n",
      "[33:34.560 --> 33:36.560]  Yeah, I think I think we did it. Nailed it.\n",
      "[33:37.560 --> 33:38.560]  That's that's genuine.\n",
      "[33:38.560 --> 33:50.560]  That's I didn't even wasn't even shooting for that goal when they're like, I saw so many things and I experienced a state of euphoria that I now don't remember what happened to me.\n",
      "[33:50.560 --> 33:51.560]  I was like, Oh, my God.\n",
      "[33:51.560 --> 33:54.560]  All I remember is that she didn't want to meet me.\n",
      "[33:54.560 --> 33:58.560]  That's it. That's all he got about.\n",
      "[33:58.560 --> 34:05.560]  And as much as much as you and I've told you this as much as you want to, you know, give New Heights credit, I give the heirs to her credit.\n",
      "[34:05.560 --> 34:11.560]  Yeah, I give the heirs to her credit because if I would have never gone to that show and then mesmerized and just been captivated.\n",
      "[34:11.560 --> 34:17.560]  Yeah. And then left with such a desire to want to meet you.\n",
      "[34:17.560 --> 34:21.560]  I would have never went on here and told everybody how butthurt I was.\n",
      "[34:21.560 --> 34:26.560]  Yeah, I'd never just been so engulfed in the curiosity of who you were.\n",
      "[34:26.560 --> 34:32.560]  Oh, that's really, really, really best things about that last statement is you didn't even know what the word engulfed meant before.\n",
      "[34:32.560 --> 34:36.560]  Like you met Taylor like this is you're broadened your horizons so far.\n",
      "[34:36.560 --> 34:38.560]  It were the perfect. I'm telling you.\n",
      "[34:38.560 --> 34:44.560]  It's so she makes me so much better.\n",
      "[34:44.560 --> 34:47.560]  Thank you for saying that. Thank you for saying that.\n",
      "[34:47.560 --> 34:54.560]  But it's like you see you on the stage and you see how crazy you can get an entire stadium going.\n",
      "[34:54.560 --> 34:58.560]  And then I get you in a room and it's like I've known you forever.\n",
      "[34:58.560 --> 35:02.560]  It's like it was just the easiest conversation I ever had.\n",
      "[35:02.560 --> 35:08.560]  And it was just so much fun that it just it knocked my socks off from what they say.\n",

      "[35:11.560 --> 35:21.560]  That's I felt she blew me away. And I had never I had never experienced something so mesmerizing on stage and then so real and so beautiful in person.\n",
      "[35:21.560 --> 35:25.560]  Hey, that's should I leave?\n",
      "[35:25.560 --> 35:30.560]  Yeah, I think so. Honestly, at this point, I think everyone should leave.\n",

      "[38:21.560 --> 38:25.560]  Like like cling film. The sourdough is taking over my life in a huge way.\n",
      "[38:25.560 --> 38:30.560]  I'm really talking about bread 60 percent of the time.\n",
      "[38:30.560 --> 38:37.560]  It's it's become it's become a huge, huge factor.\n",
      "[38:37.560 --> 38:42.560]  I mean, and she's getting good with making all these different versions of it.\n",
      "[38:42.560 --> 38:47.560]  Yeah, my favorite one was probably I mean, the regular sourdough is one of my favorites, but the blueberry.\n",

      "[39:51.560 --> 39:58.560]  This is where the Internet is a good place where you can curate a reality where like all I really use the Internet for is sourdough.\n",
      "[39:58.560 --> 40:04.560]  And when Travis shows me videos of otters on his Instagram algorithm, I want to wild.\n",
      "[40:04.560 --> 40:06.560]  I want a wild otter so bad.\n",
      "[40:06.560 --> 40:09.560]  I just want to like find these little creatures.\n",
      "[40:09.560 --> 40:12.560]  Yeah, he does. But he wants wild one.\n",
      "[40:12.560 --> 40:14.560]  Why wouldn't you?\n",
      "[40:14.560 --> 40:16.560]  Aren't they all wild?\n",

      "[40:24.560 --> 40:28.560]  It's a really specific type of otter he's looking for.\n",
      "[40:28.560 --> 40:31.560]  The videos that I watch are somebody just in a canoe.\n",
      "[40:31.560 --> 40:34.560]  Yeah, he doesn't want to like go up to an otter and take it from its mother.\n",
      "[40:34.560 --> 40:39.560]  He wants to see an otter and the otter is like my paw is caught in a shell.\n",
      "[40:39.560 --> 40:41.560]  And he's like, I got you.\n",
      "[40:41.560 --> 40:52.560]  And then the otters like, thank you forever with its little paws and then it swims up and then it's and you're kayaking and it's like doing this to you.\n",
      "[40:52.560 --> 40:53.560]  Like, that's what he wants.\n",
      "[40:53.560 --> 40:54.560]  And I want it to honestly.\n",
      "[40:54.560 --> 40:55.560]  Who doesn't?\n",

      "[40:56.560 --> 40:59.560]  Yeah. So do otters eat bread?\n",
      "[40:59.560 --> 41:02.560]  Can we get a sourdough eating otter that might be perfect?\n",
      "[41:02.560 --> 41:04.560]  We're going to figure it. We're going to figure that out.\n",

      "[41:06.560 --> 41:07.560]  They're probably.\n",
      "[41:07.560 --> 41:13.560]  But yeah, we had discussed maybe like carrying around cans of sardines just in case we run into one.\n",
      "[41:13.560 --> 41:14.560]  Nice.\n",
      "[41:14.560 --> 41:17.560]  It's better in principle than it is in practice.\n",
      "[41:17.560 --> 41:19.560]  Easier to conceptualize.\n",
      "[41:19.560 --> 41:20.560]  It seems pretty easy though.\n",
      "[41:20.560 --> 41:22.560]  You just got to go canoeing.\n",
      "[41:22.560 --> 41:27.560]  Which is also easier in principle than it is in practice for us in terms of just the weight balance.\n",

      "[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:38.000]  And I actually that's not normal.\n",
      "[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:39.920]  Yeah, it's not normal.\n",
      "[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.040]  There are people just willing to go to bat for you and be like,\n",
      "[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.360]  you don't understand this guy's incredible.\n",

      "[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.480]  So he is doing incredibly well.\n",
      "[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.680]  My dad had an interesting summer.\n",
      "[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.720]  He actually had a quintuple bypass surgery.\n",
      "[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.480]  And that's a really intense surgery.\n",
      "[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.360]  Yeah. So it all happened really quick.\n",
      "[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:07.680]  He went in.\n",
      "[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:11.320]  I know he would want me to say this because he really like he learned a lot\n",
      "[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:12.920]  through this process.\n",
      "[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:17.560]  He's had a healthy, perfect EKG every year that he's gone in to get his physicals.\n",
      "[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.520]  Yeah. Perfect EKG. Yeah.\n",
      "[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.560]  But what what found his five\n",
      "[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:26.360]  hard blockages in his heart was a resting stress test.\n",
      "[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.960]  So he's been telling all his friends, you need to get the stress test\n",
      "[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:30.880]  because that's what's actually preventative.\n",
      "[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:34.240]  If you can find that earlier, you don't have to have a bypass surgery.\n",
      "[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:37.760]  You can you can sort out those blockages with stents and things\n",
      "[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.000]  that are a lot less invasive.\n",
      "[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.080]  So he finds out that he's got these blockages.\n",
      "[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.200]  They're like, this is we got to do this like tomorrow.\n",
      "[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:49.200]  Yeah. You you you shouldn't like we don't know how you walked in here, dude.\n",

      "[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.280]  So he was, of course, saying to our family, he was like, you guys are busy.\n",
      "[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:58.720]  I don't want you guys to have to like come in here.\n",
      "[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.240]  Like you and Austin are busy.\n",
      "[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.640]  Like just don't you don't have to do this.\n",
      "[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.640]  Like don't bring dad, the strong dad.\n",
      "[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.440]  That's right.\n",
      "[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.160]  He he said something about like when a cat is injured,\n",
      "[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.360]  it curls up around a tree and heals itself.\n",
      "[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.680]  I was like, Dad, cats don't have quintuple bypass.\n",
      "[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.720]  He tried to relate.\n",
      "[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.080]  You're just saying stuff now.\n",
      "[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.680]  That doesn't mean anything to me.\n",
      "[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.320]  And so I was like, OK, I'm not going to come there.\n",
      "[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.800]  All right. Like, yeah.\n",
      "[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.800]  So he wakes up from surgery and it's it's my mom, my brother and me\n",
      "[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:27.880]  and his best friend.\n",
      "[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:34.880]  And he comes out of surgery and he was he did like a comedy act,\n",
      "[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.280]  a comedy set for like 15 minutes.\n",
      "[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.400]  He was the funniest he's ever been.\n",
      "[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.000]  And he's funny.\n",
      "[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.480]  But he's like he he we didn't know how many blockages he had.\n",
      "[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.920]  And I was like, Dad, you had a quintuple bypass.\n",
      "[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.600]  You had five. That's crazy.\n",
      "[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.400]  It's more than we thought.\n",
      "[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:51.360]  And he's like, well, you see, I come from a very competitive family.\n",
      "[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:58.360]  And it was kind of wild because it was like it was very parent child\n",
      "[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.920]  reversal in a lot of ways.\n",
      "[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.880]  Like my brother and my mom and I were each taking shifts in the ICU\n",

      "[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.640]  And they'd be like, you have a test tomorrow.\n",
      "[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.360]  You need to rest.\n",
      "[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.840]  We're taking your phone, whatever.\n",
      "[01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.200]  Yeah, I get to the hospital.\n",

      "[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:44.920]  I then go and look at all the other comments and then Twitter just feeds me more.\n",

      "[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:44.760]  Do I get to say it?\n",

      "[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:01.800]  Typically, we would allow the guests to say new news.\n",

      "[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:06.440]  But with Zach Brown, we had another bit that we did.\n",

      "[01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:22.360]  I think Taylor has a little bit of new news.\n",
      "[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:27.240]  She's a natural.\n",
      "[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:27.720]  She's a natural.\n",
      "[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:29.320]  It was as fun as I thought it was going to be.\n",
      "[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:31.240]  Oh, it was everything.\n",
      "[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.280]  It was everything and more.\n",
      "[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.800]  We did talk about Easter eggs earlier.\n",
      "[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:36.200]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:40.040]  And at the very last heiress tour, you didn't take the lift.\n",
      "[01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:40.600]  You did not.\n",
      "[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.360]  You went upstage and exited through an orange door.\n",
      "[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.840]  Why did you change the ending?\n",
      "[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:50.680]  So that's I'm happy you mentioned that.\n",
      "[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:52.600]  I'm about to say, Jason, did you see that fans?\n",
      "[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:53.960]  Did you see that the fans noticed this?\n",
      "[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.800]  Because I was pretty proud of them for noticing that.\n",
      "[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:59.720]  They know I just, yeah, I was surfing the internet and saw something.\n",
      "[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.040]  Yeah.\n",
      "[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:04.600]  So that was, I was pretty happy that they noticed that I was like, trained them well.\n",
      "[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:10.280]  So basically every night of the errors, everything happens with the reason Taylor's a planner.\n",
      "[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:12.120]  She's not just a random orange door.\n",
      "[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:14.440]  What's happening there?\n",
      "[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:16.040]  Why is why and why?\n",
      "[01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:20.440]  Anyway, so I would leave the stage every night going down the elevator lift.\n",
      "[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:24.680]  That's how every single era's show ended except for one, except for the last one,\n",
      "[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:30.680]  where I exited through a door, an orange door to be specific.\n",
      "[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.720]  And that actually was an Easter egg.\n",
      "[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:40.760]  Basically, the reason why I chose to exit that way is because I kind of wanted to\n",
      "[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:45.640]  give a little subliminal hint to the fans that I may be leaving the era's tour era,\n",
      "[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:52.680]  but I was also entering a new era.\n",
      "[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.120]  So I wanted to show you something.\n",
      "[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:55.320]  Okay.\n",
      "[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.280]  What do we got?\n",
      "[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:59.640]  We got a briefcase.\n",
      "[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:00.200]  Yep.\n",

      "[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:24.280]  It was something that I was working on while I was in Europe on the era's tour.\n",

      "[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:27.880]  I would be on tour.\n",

      "[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.720]  It really, it really feels like, I don't know.\n",
      "[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:19.320]  It feels like kind of energetically how my life has felt.\n",
      "[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:25.080]  And this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during\n",
      "[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:30.600]  this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant.\n",
      "[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:38.920]  And one of the things about this record is like, it's a record I made with my mentor,\n",
      "[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:40.600]  Max Martin and Shellback.\n",
      "[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:44.760]  And the three of us have made some of my favorite songs that I've ever done before.\n",
      "[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:45.160]  Nice.\n",
      "[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:46.680]  Which ones, if you don't mind me asking?\n",
      "[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:49.880]  Well, they were my main collaborators on the Red album.\n",
      "[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:53.080]  We did We Are Never Getting Back Together, I Knew You Were Trouble, 22,\n",
      "[01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:57.240]  Shake It Off, Blank Space, Style, Wildest Dreams.\n",
      "[01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:57.800]  Oh, hell yes.\n",
      "[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.560]  You know, ready for it.\n",
      "[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.560]  So that's the energy we're going with.\n",
      "[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:05.240]  Yes, I understand why it's orange now.\n",
      "[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:05.480]  Okay.\n",
      "[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:08.920]  So yeah, we've made songs that I'm so proud of.\n",
      "[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:10.360]  There's going to be some fucking bangers.\n",
      "[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:11.480]  Yes, I'm picking it up.\n",
      "[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:12.920]  Yeah, it's like that.\n",
      "[01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:13.640]  I'm telling you it's 12.\n",
      "[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:14.200]  It's like that.\n",
      "[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:19.320]  And so basically, we've never actually made an album before where it's just the three of us.\n",
      "[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.600]  There's no other collaborators.\n",
      "[01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:27.160]  It's just the three of us making a focused album where, I mean, it felt like catching\n",
      "[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:28.520]  lightning in a bottle, honestly.\n",
      "[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.760]  We hadn't worked together in like seven or eight years.\n",
      "[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:32.200]  And...\n",
      "[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:32.920]  This feeds.\n",
      "[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:34.200]  This feeds.\n",
      "[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:35.560]  They're just awesome.\n",
      "[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:36.680]  They're just something.\n",
      "[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.040]  There's something about it.\n",
      "[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:43.560]  These guys, they're just geniuses in different avenues, in different ways.\n",
      "[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:45.400]  We kind of...\n",
      "[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:48.360]  I'm gonna put it down.\n",
      "[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:49.800]  I just...\n",
      "[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:50.200]  Travis, hold it.\n",
      "[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:50.680]  I've just never...\n",
      "[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:53.080]  Today's the first day I've seen it.\n",
      "[01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:53.640]  Do you know what I mean?\n",
      "[01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:54.120]  I'm just like...\n",
      "[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.720]  So Travis is just gonna cradle it the whole time.\n",
      "[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:58.680]  Don't drop the baby.\n",
      "[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:00.040]  I will not drop this baby.\n",
      "[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:04.680]  So it's like working with them again was absolutely incredible.\n",
      "[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:08.600]  And actually, when I was on tour in Stockholm, I had Max Martin come out to the show.\n",
      "[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:11.320]  And I was talking to him and I was like, I just feel like...\n",
      "[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:16.280]  I feel like we could just knock it out of the park if we went back in.\n",
      "[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:19.400]  And we did this all in Sweden and it was just us three.\n",
      "[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:21.800]  Like, I want to...\n",
      "[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:26.200]  I essentially said to him, I want to be as proud of an album as I am of the era's tour.\n",
      "[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:27.240]  And for the same reasons.\n",
      "[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.800]  And he was like, do you understand what kind of pressure that is?\n",
      "[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:33.400]  Yeah, I was about to say, that is okay.\n",
      "[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.520]  I was like, yeah.\n",
      "[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:35.640]  Why would you...\n",
      "[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:36.360]  Yeah, we can try.\n",
      "[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:36.760]  Let's try.\n",
      "[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:37.800]  So your entire career?\n",
      "[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:38.200]  Got it.\n",
      "[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.320]  Yeah, we can do that in one album.\n",

      "[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:15.000]  Those were a little bit more like alt-folk kind of leaning and just kind of exploring\n",

      "[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:21.480]  And I feel like both Max and Shellback did that too in their own ways going out into the world.\n",
      "[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:26.760]  And by the time we came back together, I feel like we had so much more dexterity to what we do.\n",

      "[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:39.240]  And Max was the mentor.\n",
      "[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:43.240]  And this was the time where it felt like all three of us in the room were carrying the same weight as creators.\n",

      "[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:17.640]  And so that effervescence has come through on this record.\n",
      "[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:19.720]  And like, as you said, bangers.\n",
      "[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:24.520]  And we were just like, there's no other songs coming.\n",
      "[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:28.680]  It's not like with Torture Poets Department, I was like, here's a data dump of everything I've thought.\n",

      "[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.800]  I love it.\n",
      "[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:42.760]  I love this so much.\n",
      "[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:44.440]  So where do we start?\n",
      "[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:45.320]  I don't know where to start.\n",
      "[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.160]  You gave us a lot of information right there.\n",

      "[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:50.600]  We didn't tell Jason that we were doing this.\n",
      "[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:52.600]  I just said, can I go on the podcast?\n",
      "[01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.600]  Because Brad Pitt did it and I want to do it too.\n",
      "[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:58.120]  Jason was like, yes, I mean, we can make that happen.\n",
      "[01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:02.280]  The request or the ask from either one of us was never going to come.\n",
      "[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:04.520]  I don't know why I would never ask you.\n",

      "[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.560]  We waited until I had some stuff to say, I think.\n",
      "[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:14.040]  There we go.\n",
      "[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:17.800]  You know, I was waiting until I had like a sparkly briefcase to bring.\n",
      "[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:19.640]  I needed props.\n",
      "[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:21.560]  It took a long time to put that into production.\n",

      "[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:27.800]  And do you want to tell everybody when it's coming out?\n",

      "[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:01.720]  It felt like every song was a poem.\n",

      "[01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:58.680]  And that focus and that kind of discipline with creating an album and keeping the bar\n",
      "[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:01.800]  really high is something I've been wanting to do for a very long time.\n",
      "[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:04.920]  I tend to love to write lots and lots of music.\n",
      "[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:09.160]  So it's a temptation to release lots of music.\n",
      "[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:09.640]  Sure.\n",
      "[01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:16.760]  I wanted to do an album that was so focused on quality and on the theme and everything\n",
      "[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:22.360]  fitting together like a perfect puzzle that these 12 songs from my 12th album,\n",
      "[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:26.120]  I feel like we achieved that and I'm really happy about that.\n",
      "[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:28.040]  So you mentioned a couple of things there.\n",
      "[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:34.360]  First, what is the theme of the album if you would describe it as one theme, if that's possible?\n",
      "[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:37.560]  I would say it's everything that was going on behind the curtain.\n",
      "[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:40.040]  Okay. And then what are the goals?\n",
      "[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:43.880]  You said something like, what would be your main goals with this album?\n",
      "[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:49.480]  My main goals were melodies that were so infectious that you're almost angry at it.\n",
      "[01:41:49.880 --> 01:42:00.760]  And lyrics that are just as vivid, but crisp and focused and completely intentional.\n",
      "[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:01.240]  Check.\n",
      "[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:07.000]  So it's like, I feel like we actually came together in a really beautiful way.\n",
      "[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:13.080]  The three of us, Shellback, Max and I, where we had a conversation about how Max was like,\n",
      "[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:14.360]  I loved folklore.\n",
      "[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.520]  I loved the storytelling on folklore.\n",
      "[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:19.160]  I don't want that to change.\n",
      "[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:27.560]  Just because we're making these infectious anthems, I don't want you to leave that behind.\n",
      "[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:30.040]  And I was like, I don't think I couldn't if I tried.\n",
      "[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:33.000]  I got some stuff to say.\n",
      "[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.240]  I'm married to that kind of writing.\n",
      "[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:41.320]  And so it was really amazing that we were able to, without doing too much overthinking,\n",
      "[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:42.600]  we were able to get in there.\n",
      "[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:46.760]  And it was just ideas flying.\n",
      "[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:52.280]  And all of these ideas were like, we've been waiting years to come back together and make\n",
      "[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:52.920]  this project.\n",
      "[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:55.400]  You are going to move.\n",
      "[01:42:58.680 --> 01:42:59.480]  Do I have to wait till October 3rd?\n",

      "[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:08.600]  I completely get it.\n",
      "[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:09.320]  Completely get it.\n",
      "[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:14.680]  The artwork, how do you settle on a front piece of artwork for an album?\n",
      "[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:16.120]  This represents the end of my night.\n",
      "[01:43:17.240 --> 01:43:21.560]  So when I'm on tour, I have the same day every single day.\n",
      "[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:24.120]  It's another reason why we have a very similar life.\n",

      "[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:44.200]  It's on the front of it.\n",
      "[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:53.800]  I wanted to sort of like glamorize all the different aspects of how that tour felt.\n",

      "[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:02.040]  That was just uncalled for.\n",
      "[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.080]  Why didn't Elliot already do it?\n",
      "[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:06.200]  You find out.\n",

This is a special preseason episode that we decided to bring to you a little early. Our guest today is the singer, songwriter, producer and director from Nashville, Tennessee. That's bullshit. She is from waiting. She is the most awarded artist in the history of the American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards and I Heart Radio Music Awards. She has 14 Grammy Awards and is the only artist in the history to an album of the year four times. Last December, she wrapped up the Heiress tour, which spanned 149 shows across 51 cities, five continents. It was the most attended tour of all time. I'm still going. Her last album, the Torture Post Department set a record with 1.76 billion streams globally within the first week alone.
